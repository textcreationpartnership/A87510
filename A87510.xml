            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom verſe the 15th, unto the 20th, we have a full, and pithie deſcription of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Chriſt Jeſus; and that by his
<hi>inward,</hi> by his <hi>outward relation.</hi> Firſt, <hi>by the intrinſecal relation</hi> he beareth unto his Father, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 15th verſe; who is the <hi>Image of the inviſible God.</hi> As for his
<hi>extrinſecal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; they are either unto the creatures, in
<hi>general,</hi> or elſe unto the Church, in <hi>ſpecial:</hi> Unto the creatures in <hi>general,</hi> he carrieth the relation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Of firſt borne; <hi>the firſt borne of every creature:</hi> the latter part of the
15th verſe. 2. Of Creator and Preſerver, verſes 16th and 17th. Unto the Church in <hi>ſpeciall</hi> he is referred, as <hi>head,</hi> verſe 18th.
<hi>And he is the head<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168371:4"/>of the body, the Church.</hi> Of which relation we have <hi>an amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> a <hi>confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. An <hi>amplification</hi> from two other titles dependant thereon, and reſulting therefrom: Who <hi>is the beginning, the firſt borne from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence:</hi> Who is the <hi>beginning;</hi> that is, the cauſe and principle unto all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their reſurrection; of their ſpiritual reſurrection from the death of ſinne here; of their corporal reſurrection from the grave, the death of nature hereafter. <hi>The firſt borne from the dead;</hi> the firſt that was borne from the dead; <hi>that is,</hi> the firſt that roſe by his own power, unto a preſent and plenary participation of glory: <hi>That in all things he might have the preheminence,</hi> In that he was not only a Creator, and Preſerver of the living, but alſo a raiſer, and reſtorer of the dead. Of this relation of headſhip unto his Church we have 2 a
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> from his fitneſs, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for it. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell</hi> Upon which words we may look 1. according to the reference they have of a proof unto the foregoing. 2. as they are in themſelves.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>According to the reference</hi> they have of a proof unto the foregoing, which is implied in the particle, <hi>(for.)</hi> Here to clear the Apoſtles meaning, we muſt know, there is wanting this propoſition: He, in whom all fulneſs dwelleth, is to be the head of the Church. This is to be ſupplied, as neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and then we have a full, compleat ſyllogiſme to prove Chriſt the head of the Church. He, in whom all fulneſs dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, is to be the head of the Church, becauſe qualified, and fitted for it; but in Chriſt dwelleth all fulneſs, and that by his Father's decree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he is the head of the body, the Church. In the head of the Church, you ſee, there reſides <hi>all-fulneſs.</hi> Were it not ſo, the Apoſtle had reaſoned but weakly, in inferring Chriſt's being head of the Church, from the dwelling of all-fulneſs in him. If any one want this fulneſs, it will goe well with him if among the members of the Church he can find a place; of <hi>head,</hi> the name, and honour, he cannot challenge, without the juſt imputation of exceſſive, both pride, and folly. I cannot but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then, how it comes about, that the Popes of Rome have for a long time laid ſo eager claime unto this title: for what fulneſs,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168371:4"/>ſave that of <hi>ſin, and Satan,</hi> can be aſcribed unto the greateſt part of them, ſince their arrogant, and ſacrilegious uſurpation of this incommunicable attribute of our Redeemer. We may ſay of them as <hi>Paul</hi> of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29:
<hi>they are filled with all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſnes, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity:</hi> &amp; of this, the miſerable face of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whole Chriſtendome is too palpable an evidence. Antichriſt is ſtiled in ſcriptures <hi>that man of ſin,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.3. For this reaſon perhaps, becauſe he is not only full of ſin, but the fulneſs of ſinne dwelleth in him. Sathan hath filled his heart, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake of
<hi>Ananias, Act.</hi> 5.3. And good reaſon there is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhould communicate unto him a <hi>double portion,</hi> the greateſt portion of his ſpirit, for he is his eldeſt ſonne, the <hi>ſonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.3. his vicar-general, the moſt powerful and univerſal agent he hath here upon earth.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee <hi>ſtandeth the context.</hi> If we look upon the words, as they are in themſelves, ſo for the better unfolding of them, we muſt know, that in Chriſt there was a manifold fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſs according to the diverſe conſiderations of him; and conſidered he may be either <hi>relatively,</hi> or
<hi>abſolutely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Relatively,</hi> and ſo againe three wayes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As an object</hi> of all promiſes, and prophecies delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law: and alſo as an <hi>antitype</hi> unto legal types and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And ſo there was in him that <hi>fulneſs of truth,</hi> of which the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>John.</hi> 1.14.
<hi>The word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, full of grace, and truth.</hi> He is ſaid to be <hi>full of truth,</hi> becauſe he is the performance of the promiſes, the fulfilling of the prophecies, the fulfilling of the typical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations, of the whole ceremonial law. <hi>Quia plenus gratiae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bonaventure, tulit peccata; quia plenus veritatis ſolvit legis promiſſa:</hi> becauſe <hi>full of grace,</hi> therefore he bore our ſins in his body on the tree, and ſo ſuffered the curſe of the Law; becauſe <hi>full of truth,</hi> therefore he accompliſht all the promiſes of the old Teſtament. <hi>In him all the promiſes of God were yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. Now, <hi>I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was a miniſter of the circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirme the promiſes made unto the fathers,</hi> Rom. 15.8. Full he was of truth, becauſe in him were fulfilled all the prophecies, that ran of the Evangelical Church,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168371:5"/>and therefore he is ſaid <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>to ſeale up the viſion and the prophecies. Quoniàm Chriſtus eſt ſignaculum omnium prophetarum, adimplens. omnia quae retro erant de eo nunciata,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Judaeos</hi> obſerveth upon the place. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt</hi> is the ſeal of the prophets, fulfilling whatſoever was foretold of him. Full he was of truth, becauſe he made good the prefigurations of the whole ceremonial law. In them there was an emptineſs; they were but <hi>ſhadowes, figures,</hi> Col. 2.17. A fulneſs then there muſt be in Chriſt, who is the body of thoſe ſhadowes, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe figures: In him they were to be filled full, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, perfected, and accompliſhed. And ſo the new Teſtament, whereof he is the ſubſtance, is ſaid, by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> to fill up, or fulfil the old, becauſe whatſoever was promiſed, or prefigured in this, is really, and truely exhibited in that, 1<hi rend="sup">
                  <hi>a</hi>
               </hi> 2^<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">ae</hi> quaeſt.</hi>
107. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>that in him dwelleth all fulneſs of the God head bodily, Lombard thinkes</hi> that
<hi>bodily,</hi> is as much as <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletivè: So that he underſtands by the words, Chriſts fulfilling the ſignes, and ceremonies of the law: For as they are ſaid to be ſhadowes of things to come, not in a proper, but metaphoricall ſenſe, and in reference to them God was ſaid to dwell in the material Temple, made with Hands, only</hi> umbratilitèr, <hi>after a typical, darke, umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and latent way: Even ſo the fulneſs of the God-head is ſaid to dwell in him</hi> bodily, <hi>only metaphorically, in oppoſition to legal ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, becauſe God by him accompliſht whatſoever they prefigured, or ſhadowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence then we may inferre the plucking away of <hi>Moſes</hi> his vail, the abrogation of all Levitical <hi>ſacraments, ſacrifices, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> all <hi>typical ceremonies</hi> whatſoever. When we have Chriſt the Antitype, there is no need of the ceremonies, the Types: they are as the bones, Chriſt as the marrow; and therefore the perverſe Jewes are
<hi>fitly by Jerome</hi> compared unto dogs, in that as dogs they doe as it were only gnaw the bones, dote on the bare types, and in the mean while neglect Chriſt Jeſus, the marrow, Mannah hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in them. <hi>The law was</hi> given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> full of types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, voyd and emptie of grace, <hi>but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John. 1.17. As grace to pardon the <hi>breaches.,</hi> to remove the <hi>curſes,</hi> to enable for obedience unto the <hi>precepts</hi> of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law; ſo truth to aboliſh the <hi>types, and reſemblances</hi> of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168371:5"/>law. Whereupon he is termed the <hi>end of the law,</hi> Rom.
10.4. to note, that all the ceremonies of the law had in him their perfection, and accompliſhment, and conſequently period, and aboliſhment. They were but figures, and preſence of the truth nullifies all figures; they were but ſhadowes, and preſence of the body, and ſubſtance evacuates all ſhadowes: they were but obſcure glimmerings, weak and faint repreſentations, darke and miſty prefigurations of the <hi>day ſpring from on high,</hi> that is, a light to them which ſate in darkneſs, a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of the people Iſrael. When this light therefore is riſen upon the world, they muſt needs vaniſh, it's brightneſs and luſtre cannot but dimme tapers, and candles in compariſon of the ſunne of righteouſneſs: and approach of the ſunn makes all leſſer lights uſeleſs. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his firſt <hi>Homily ſuper miſſus eſt,</hi> tels us, that the promiſes made of Chriſt unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaacke,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were as the ſeed, the types foreſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing him as the bloſſoms, Chriſt himſelfe as the fruites.</p>
            <p>Anſwerable unto which <hi>is that of Aquinas prim. ſecun. quaeſt.</hi> 107. <hi>Art.</hi> 3: that the new Teſtament, where of Chriſt is the ſumme, is contained in the old, <hi>tanquam frumentum in ſpicâ, tanquam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in ſemine.</hi> Now <hi>prodeunte fructu, flos decidit; quia veritate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parente in carne, figura pertranſit:</hi> when the fruit appeares the bloſſome fals off; when the truth appeareth in the fleſh, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure thereof paſſeth away. All Levitical rites were but
<hi>promiſſiva ſigna, as Auſtin</hi> termeth them, predictions of Chriſt to come, and therefore farther obſervation of them would be a flat, and real denial of Chriſts comming in the fleſh. But now this ceſſation of the ceremonies was not at once, in an inſtant, but <hi>ſenſim, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latim,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> leaſurely by degrees, by little and little. As the myſtery of our redemption ſignified by them, had it's
<hi>inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in the cratch at the birth of Chriſt, it's
<hi>conſummatum</hi> on the croſs, at the death, and paſſion of Chriſt. Even ſo the ceremonies of the law themſelves began to ceaſe upon Chriſt's comming, but were together with the ſins of the world to be
<hi>utterly cancelled upon the croſs,</hi> Epheſ. 2.15,16. Col. 2.14.
<hi>Aquinas prim. ſecun. quaeſt.</hi> 103. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. upon the firſt breaking out of the light of the ſun of righteouſneſs upon the world, all ſhadowes began to waſt &amp; leſſen: Upon the initial promulgation of the Goſpel in Chriſt's<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168371:6"/>own perſonal preaching, nay, upon the very proclamation of Chriſts approach by his forerunner, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al law was in <hi>the waine;</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, that the <hi>Prophets, and the law proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ſied until John,</hi> Math. 11.13: becauſe, however the ceremonial law was not abrogated by
<hi>John,</hi> or as ſoon as <hi>John</hi> preached, yet <hi>aegrotare tunc caepit,</hi> as <hi>Maldonate</hi> hath it, <hi>non multò poſt Chriſti mortem moritura;</hi> it thereupon began preſently to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, weaken and ſicken; and upon the croſs it actually gave up the Ghoſt: To which purpoſe ſome have obſerved, that the laſt character of the Hebrew Alphabet was a plaine figure of Chriſt's croſs, to ſhew, that his ſacrifice thereon ended all legal ſacrifices, and ordinances whatſoever. But now, however <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monialia</hi> preſently upon Chriſts death became
<hi>mortua,</hi> dead, void of all efficacy, and power to bind, yet were they not <hi>mortifera,</hi> deadly, until there was a plenary promulgation of the Goſpel. And therefore the Apoſtles gave them an honourable funeral by obſervation of them, even after their power of obligation was quite expired in Chriſt's death.</p>
            <p>From this abrogation of Jewiſh ceremonies ſome of the ableſt patrons of humane ceremonies of <hi>myſtical</hi> ſignification, doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to diſpute againſt the pedagogy, and ſchoole of them, whereby the myſteries of faith, and doctrines of the goſpel are wrapped up in new ſhadowes, which God had freed from the old, which were of his own inſtitution, and meant to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed plainely by the preaching of the Goſpel, and Sacraments, a cleerer kind of teaching; and not againe to be adumbrated by new ſhadowes: for this were to turne us back to our ſpelling book. So Doctor <hi>John Burges</hi> in his rejoynder to <hi>Ames</hi> pag.

            <p>But the old <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> were not content with this, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued hence farther for the aboliſhing of all ſignificant ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of humane inſtitution whatſoever, not only thoſe which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

2.17: where he alleadgeth divers ſentences out of them, wherein they explaine, what they thought it to be. In the firſt ſeven dayes of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover, the Jewes were by the ceremonial law to eate unleavened bread, and to put away leaven out of their houſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15.</p>
            <p>Now that the duty of Believers was ſhadowed by this ceremony, appeares by <hi>Paul's</hi> application of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7,8. <hi>Purge out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.

Therefore let us keep the feaſt not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice, and wickedneſs: but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:168371:7"/>Thus you ſee clearly proved, that many legal ceremonies did only ſhadow out ſome duty to be performed by Believers, who are the body of Chriſt. And this place, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17: is to be extended unto all legal rites whatſoever, and therefore all of them are to be aboliſhed, not only thoſe, which ſignified Chriſt to come, but alſo thoſe, which taught the Church by their ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now from this ground the Authours of the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that book, which the Miniſters of Lincolne Dioceſs deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to King <hi>James,</hi> pag. 41.42. conclude, that all humane ceremonies, being appropriated to God's ſervice, if they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to teach any ſpiritual duty by their myſtical ſignification, are unlawful. <hi>It is much leſs lawful for man to bring ſignificant ceremonies into God's worſhip now, then it was under the Law. For God hath abrogated his own, not only thoſe that were appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure Chriſt, but ſuch alſo as ſerved by their ſignification to teach moral duties, ſo as now (without great ſinne) none of them can be continued in the Church, no not for ſignification. Of this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the Fathers in the Councel of Nice, and</hi> Auſtin, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Bullinger, Lavater, Hoſpinian, Piſcator, Cooper, Weſtphaling, <hi>and others. And if thoſe ceremonies that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ordained to teach his Church by their ſignification, may not now be uſed, much leſs may thoſe which man hath deviſed. This reaſon our Divines hold to be ſtrong againſt popiſh ceremonies, namely,</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Bullinger, Hoſpinian, Arcularius, Virel, D. Bilſon, D. Rainolds, D. Willet, <hi>and others. Yeae this is one maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which God hath put between the ſtate of that Church under the Law, and this under the Goſpel, that he thought good to teach</hi> that <hi>by other myſtical ceremonies, beſides the ordinary Sacraments, and not</hi> thiis.
<hi>And of this judgment is</hi> Calvin, Bullinger, Chemnitius, Danae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Hoſpinian, Arcularius, <hi>our book of Homilies,</hi> D. Humfry, D. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, D. Willet, <hi>and others. All which Divines doe teach that to bring in ſignificant ceremonies into the Church of Chriſt is plain Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme.</hi> This argument ſo pinched Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> and after him D. <hi>John Burges,</hi> who undetook in his behalfe to rejoyne unto the reply of D. <hi>Ames,</hi> as that to avoid the force of it, they both affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the uſe of ſome Jewiſh rites with a mind or intention not Jewiſh, is lawful; and they inſtance in circumciſion, as it is uſed under <hi>Preſter John,</hi> not as a Sacrament or as <hi>neceſſary,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:168371:7"/>but <hi>as a national, and cuſtomary rite.</hi> The falſhood and danger of which aſſertion, you may read at large confirmed by <hi>D. Ames</hi> in his freſh ſuit againſt ceremonies, <hi>pag.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, we may hence learne, what a gratious mercy of God it is unto us to be reſerved until this <hi>time of Reformation,</hi> as the Apoſtle termes the time of the Chriſtian adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. wherein we have fully, and really exhibited that, which was but promiſed, and foreſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed unto the Jewes. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we received grace for grace,</hi> John. 1.16. that is, (as
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expounds the words) for the grace of the old Teſtament, the grace of the new; for darke figures, and reſemblances, the things figured and reſembled, for obſcure ſhadowes, the very truth and ſubſtance: for the paſchal lambe, the Lambe of God. For typical ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the true expiatory ſacrifice of Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe: for ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical high Prieſts, a great high Prieſt, that is <hi>paſſed into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Jeſus the Son of God,</hi> Heb. 4.14. For a Moſaical Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a true, a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, <hi>not of this building,</hi> Heb. 9.11. For that antiquated, and abrogated way unto the Sanctuary, the bloud of beaſts, or the material vail, which was dead, uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, unable to bring to everlaſting life, we have a new and living way, which Chriſt himſelfe hath conſecrated for us, the <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>humanity of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 10.20.</p>
            <p>Thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16,17.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be chiefly to be underſtood concerning the Apoſtles, &amp; ſuch diſciples as bodily converſed with our Saviour, yet they may be extended in ſome <hi>degree,</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> unto all Believers, after the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh. It may be ſaid unto every one of them, <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your eares for they hear. Bleſſed are the eyes, which ſee the things that ye ſee: For many. Prophets and Kings and righteous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things, which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Church before Chriſt, as our Saviour ſaid of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> John. 8.56: ſaw the day of Chriſt, his comming in the fleſh afar off, through a vail, or cloud of ceremonies, and <hi>by the faith of propheſy,</hi> Heb. 11.13. But we ſee it by the <hi>faith of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168371:8"/>Hiſtory.</hi> Unto them Chriſt was, as a <hi>Kernel</hi> hidden in the ground, as contained within God's promiſes. Unto us he is as a
<hi>branch</hi> grown forth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.2.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diodati.</hi>
               </note> Hence it is, that the ceremonies of the old Teſtament were <hi>Prophetical, prenunciative</hi> of things to come; the Sacraments of the new Teſtament <hi>Hiſtorical, comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative</hi> of what is paſt. As therefore the truth of Hiſtory is held to be more real, then the trurh of propheſy; becauſe it is a declaration of a real performance of that, which was promiſed. So the Chriſtian adminiſtration of the Covenant of grace may be ſaid to containe in it a <hi>fulneſs of truth:</hi> that is, a more real ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then the Levetical, or Moſaical. According to the which difference, as is obſerved by the reverend <hi>Morton,</hi> in his book of the inſtitution of the Lord's Supper, <hi>pag.</hi> 213. <hi>St. John</hi> the Baptiſt was called by Chriſt, a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in that he foretold Chriſt, as now to come; but he was called more then a <hi>Prophet,</hi> as demonſtrating, and pointing him out to be now come, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.15,29. The ceremonial law, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> had <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things,</hi> Hebr. 10.1. In which words <hi>Calvin, Pareus, Cornelius Alapide,</hi> and others, conceive that there is an alluſion unto the cuſtome of Painters, whoſe firſt rude or imperfect draught is termed a ſhadow, or adumbration, upon which they lay after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lively colours, &amp; ſo draw the Image unto the life with all its lineaments. The rites of the old Law were but a rough draught, but obſcure, and confuſed ſhadowes in reſpect of the ordinances of the Goſpel, which are a lively, and expreſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a diſtinct and perfect picture of Chriſt and his benefits. Thus you ſee Beloved, that God hath reſpited us to live in a time of greater light, and fuller revelation then the Patriarks li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under. O, let us not receive ſo great a grace of God in vain, but walke ſuitably thereunto: let us improve this priviledge unto the beſt advantage of our ſoules by making uſe of it, as an engagement unto a
<hi>greater</hi> eminency in knowledge and piety, then was in thoſe dayes. O! it were a ſhameful and ungrateful part, that the Saints of the old Teſtament ſhould ſee farther, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more diſtinctly, through the cloud of ceremonies, a <hi>light that ſhone in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet.
1.20: then we through the cleere mirror of the Goſpel, in which we may
<hi>with open face, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:168371:8"/>behold the glory of Chriſt ſhining,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. that their ſoules ſhould thrive, grow fat, and full with the ſhadowes of the Law, and ours be lanke and leane with the more ſolid, and ſubſtantial ordinances of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt may be conſidered under the relation of <hi>an head</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church; and ſo the Church belongeth unto him, as his
<hi>fulneſs.</hi> The <hi>Church,</hi> which is his body, <hi>the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all,</hi> Epheſ. 1.23. This aſſertion at the firſt bluſh, ſeemeth very ſtrange. For if in Chriſt dwell <hi>all fulneſs;</hi> all the fulneſs of the Godhead, <hi>bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. If he <hi>be all in all, if he fill all in all,</hi> how then can either the Church <hi>triumphant,</hi> all whoſe members owe all their perfection unto his influence, or the Church <hi>militant,</hi> which, alas! is but a company of poore creatures, and ſinners, empty of all good, ſave what floweth from him, be poſſibly imagined to be his <hi>fulneſs,</hi> any wayes to fill and perfect him? why the very propoſal of the doubt in ſome ſort cleares it. That which in the text ſeemingly contradicts the Churches being Chriſts fulneſs (he <hi>filleth all in all</hi>) inſinuates after what manner it muſt be underſtood: for from Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe ſo full, as that he <hi>filleth all in all,</hi> the inference is not only eaſy, but neceſſary, that the Church is not his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fulneſs,</hi> ſerving to ſupply his defects, and <hi>inwardly</hi> to fill and perfect him; but only his <hi>outward fulneſs,</hi> ſerving to magnify his mercy, and
<hi>outwardly</hi> to fill and honour him; and from her he hath indeed an external filling glory, and perfection. Even as a King receiveth glory from his ſubjects, <hi>in the multitude of the people is the Kings honour,</hi> Prov.
14.28. or as a husband is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by a vertuous wife, <hi>She is a crowne to him,</hi> Prov. 12.4. A Father credited by his off-ſpring, <hi>Childrens Children are the crowne of old men,</hi> Prov. 17.6. Or as a Gentleman is graced by his numerous retinue. <hi>Aquinas</hi> upon the place ſaith, that
<hi>the Church is Chriſt's fulneſs, even as the body may be ſaid to be the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoule:</hi> And the body may be ſo termed, becauſe it is for the ſervice of the ſoule, becauſe the ſoule workes in, and by it; and without it cannot put forth many of it's operations. So the Church is for the ſervice, praiſe, and glory of Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. Chriſt exerciſeth, and manifeſteth the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his ſpirit in her: She is, as it were, a veſſel, into which<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168371:9"/>he poureth his gifts, and graces. Without a body how can the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſoule be viſible? And if it were not for the Church, how could the power, and efficacy of Chriſt's grace be diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? As a general, or Commander may be ſaid to be filled, when his army is encreaſed, his <hi>conqueſts</hi> enlarged; ſo Chriſt, when <hi>Believers</hi> are
<hi>added unto the Church,</hi> Acts. 2.47. The illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not mine, but <hi>Hierom's.</hi> The expreſſion will not ſeem harſh, if we conſider the titles of the Church in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>She is the glory of God,</hi> Iſai. 4.5. <hi>Even as the woman is the glory of the man.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.7: <hi>a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal Diademe in the hand of God,</hi> Iſa. 62.3: <hi>the throne of his glory,</hi> Jer. 14.21. <hi>that is unto him a name of joy, a prayſe, a glory and an honour before all the nations of the earth,</hi> Jer. 13.11. and
33.9.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing of this text, we will conſider Chriſt, <hi>perſonally, eſſentially, myſtically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Perſonally,</hi> as he is Sonne, the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, having in the Godhead a ſubſiſtence diſtinct both from that of the father, and Holy Ghoſt; and ſo he is full of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Eſſentially,</hi> according to his natures, both Divine, and humane, as he is God, as he is man; and ſo alſo he is full by himſelfe, full and perfect God, full and perfect man. So then the Church is not his fulneſs.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Myſtically,</hi> as he is <hi>head</hi> of his Church: and ſo he is not perfect without her, being his body myſtical. So then the Church is his fulneſs. <hi>Can the head</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>ſay to the feet, I have no need of thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. Chriſt hath deigned to be our <hi>head:</hi> how then can he be full and compleat without us? As a King, the head politique, though for his own particular perſon he be never ſo abſolute, and excellent, yet as a
<hi>King,</hi> he cannot be compleat without <hi>Subjects:</hi> without them he may be a compleat <hi>man,</hi> but not a compleat <hi>King.</hi> So Chriſt, though as <hi>Sonne,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>man,</hi> he be every way full by himſelfe, yet <hi>as head</hi> he accounteth himſelfe maimed, and incompleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>members;</hi> without them he may be a compleat
<hi>Son, God, man;</hi> not a compleat <hi>head.</hi> For want of the terme, which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation reſpects, bringeth even a nullity of the relation: It being impoſſible to define, or conceive relations, but in reference to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168371:9"/>their termes. No man can be a father without children; a King without ſubjects: Even ſo nothing can be a head, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, of a body, and members.</p>
            <p>The ground of this is the neere, and expreſſeleſs vnion between Chriſt, and his members, which is ſuch, as that the members of the Church are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 3.14.</p>
            <p>And the Church hath a kind of ſubſiſtence in Chriſt, and conſequently in the Deity. The <hi>Church of the Theſſalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.1.</p>
            <p>Nay, hereupon the name of Chriſt is communicated unto the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members are of that one body, being many are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where under the name of Chriſt not only the head, but the whole body of the Church is comprized. Jeſus and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers make but one
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> one <hi>body,</hi> one <hi>perſon myſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or no this be the fulneſs in the text, is not much controverted. Indeed <hi>Theodoret</hi> with ſome few others have been of the mind that it is, but their gloſs hath little colour from either the words or ſcope of the text.</p>
            <p>For, 1. the fulneſs ſpoken of in the text is an
<hi>all-fulneſs.</hi> Now the Church (as <hi>Cornelius Alapide</hi> obſerveth) is barely ſtiled the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Chriſt, never the
<hi>all-fulneſs</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Zanchy</hi> alleadgeth another reaſon, which I for my part ſhall wave. The fulneſs of the text dwelleth in Chriſt-Now the Church (ſaith he) dwelleth not in Chriſt, however Chriſt dwelleth in the Church, and in the hearts of all his members by faith.</p>
            <p>But I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the incogitancy of ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious a Divine, when I conſider theſe following places of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.56. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6.
<hi>Iſai</hi> 33.14,15.</p>
            <p>3. But there is a <hi>third reaſon,</hi> which together with the firſt, is of a convincing nature. The <hi>all-fulneſs</hi> that is here ſaid to dwell in Chriſt, is brought by our Apoſtle as an intrinſecal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, in order of nature antecedent unto his relation of
<hi>head</hi> unto the Church, his <hi>body.</hi> Whereas the Churches being Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs</hi> is conſequent thereunto, and reſulting therefrom.</p>
            <p>And beſides, if we would ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> and
<hi>ſtrictly,</hi> it is not<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168371:10"/>ſo much an attribute given unto Chriſt, as unto the Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhould therefore diſmiſs any larger proſecution of it, and proceed; but becauſe I intend to ſpeak ſome thing of every branch of Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs,</hi> I ſhall therefore briefly hint the uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that may be made of this.</p>

To conclude this uſe, the Church is Chriſts

3.21. It is ſaid of him, that at the day of <hi>judgment he ſhall be glorified in his Saints,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.10. There is ſaith <hi>D. Sclater</hi> upon the place, <hi>a perſonal glory of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi> Joh. 17.5 <hi>And there is his ſocial glory,</hi> as I may terme it,
<hi>reſulting unto his perſon, from the glory, which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates unto his Children.</hi> And of this the Apoſtle here ſpeakes. <hi>Conjunct with the glory of Saints is the glory of Chriſt: ſo neerely, at that in their glorification, himſelfe is glorified.</hi> Every Saint then may warrantably be aſſured, that Chriſt will take all poſſible care for his glorification.</p>
            <p>2 You may hence find great cauſe of conſolation in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foreſt afflictions. For being parts of Chriſt's
<hi>fulneſs,</hi> whatſoever evil befals you, he will deeply reſent it, he will be moſt tenderly <hi>affected with</hi> it, nay exceedingly
<hi>afflicted in</hi> it. In all <hi>their afflictions</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>he was afflicted,</hi> Iſai. 63.9: that is, he compaſſionates their afflictions, and as it were ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizeth with them.

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:168371:13"/>Now the ground of Chriſt's thus ſympathizing with his members is their myſtical union with him.

1.12,13,14. As the Church then is Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs,</hi> ſo the Churches ſufferings are in ſome ſort the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the ſufferings of Chriſt; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> cals his ſufferings,

            <p>We muſt therefore with <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the place, diſtinguiſh of two ſorts of Chriſt's ſufferings, they are either,
<hi>in corpore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio,</hi> or <hi>in corpore myſtico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſufferings <hi>in corpore proprio,</hi> in his natural and humane body, had the laſts words of Chriſt, upon the Croſs, to bear witneſs unto the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of their meaſure, and merit.</p>
            <p>By the afflictions of Chriſt therefore, the remainders of which
<hi>Paul's</hi> ſufferings were ſaid to fill up, underſtand we his
<hi>general</hi> ſufferings, <hi>in corpore myſtico,</hi> in his Church, as a member with the reſt: for as head, he will ſuffer even to the end of the world in his faithful Miniſters, and members.</p>
            <p>It is uſual to attribute the wounds of the hand, or feet, unto the whole man; and therefore the Apoſtle, becauſe he is a member of the body of Chriſt, may very well call his afflictions, the <hi>afflictions of Chriſt:</hi> for Chriſt, and his members make but <hi>one Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12: and therefore that which the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and meaneſt of his members ſuffer, he alſo ſuffereth.</p>
            <p>When his hungry and thirſty members are not relieved with meat and drink; when his members, that are forced to flee from City, to City, and to be ſtrangers unto their native ſoile, are<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168371:14"/>not taken in, and hoſpitably entertained; when his naked mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not cloathed, when his ſick and impriſoned members are not viſited, and miniſtred unto, be interprets the neglect, and omiſſion of theſe offices of love towards his members, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon himſelfe. He ſhall at the laſt day ſay,
<hi>verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me,</hi> Math. 25.42,43,44,45. Well therefore
<hi>droop</hi> not under any condition, though never ſo ſad, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly deſperate, under any want and diſtreſs, though never ſo great, and in the eye of ſenſe and carnal reaſon never ſo reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs. For if you are members of Chriſt, Chriſt you ſee hath a ſhare in all your miſeries, and preſſures, and therefore you may aſſure your ſelves of his preſence to ſweeten them unto you, and of his ſpirit to ſtrengthen, and ſupport you under them.</p>
            <p>3. We may hence inferre the <hi>ſtability</hi> of the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of every member of the Church in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>ſtability</hi> of the Church in <hi>general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs,</hi> and therefore it ſhall never fail.</p>
            <p>What man would ſuffer himſelfe to be mutilated, and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, if he were able to hinder it? And will Chriſt then, think you, ſuffer any thing to prevaile againſt his Church, which is his
<hi>fulneſs?</hi> What were that but to mayme and imcompleate him? For the preſervation of the Church Chriſt hath a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold influence upon her; and that perpetual, irreſiſtable, and uninterrupted, <hi>the influence of his truth, and the influence of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The influence of his truth</hi> to teach and enlighten her,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The influence of his power</hi> to guide and protect her, ſo that the gates of hell ſhall never be able to prevail againſt her,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.</p>
            <p>2. We may hence inferre the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of every member of the Church in <hi>particular.</hi> If you are members of the Church, and ſo parts of Chriſt's <hi>fulnes,</hi> why then reſt aſſured of perpetual preſervation in that ſtate of union and fellowſhip, you enjoy with him. <hi>The mountaines ſhall depart, and the hills be removed,</hi> Iſai. 54.10. <hi>But you ſhall be as mount Zion, which cannot be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168371:14"/>removed, but abideth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 125.1 For as members, you make Chriſt, your head, more full; and ſo loſs of you would be a great blemiſh, and as it were mayming to his <hi>body myſtical,</hi> which that he ſhould not hinder, we cannot ſo much as imagine but with infinite wrong, unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his power, or wiſedome, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37.

            <p>4 The members of the Church may hence be comforted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of death. Is the Church Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs,</hi> why then every member of the Church may be aſſured of a reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto a glorious, and immortal life: for Chriſt will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any part of his
<hi>fulneſs</hi> to be overwhelmed with corruption, but will aſſuredly
<hi>raiſe them,</hi> and ſet <hi>them in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 2.6. But of this I have ſpoken at large, <hi>pag.</hi> 149, 150: and therefore thither I ſhall referre the Reader.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, you may hence be comforted againſt a
<hi>low degree,</hi> and a <hi>low eſteem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Againſt a <hi>low degree, ſtate,</hi> or
<hi>condition.</hi> Suppoſe you are of never ſo <hi>low degree,</hi> why to be a part of Chriſt's <hi>fulneſs,</hi> is a more true, real, and greater honour then the dignity of the greateſt Potentates, <hi>who are without Chriſt in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, if you are members of the Church, here is wonderful comfort to you againſt that baſe and <hi>low eſteem,</hi> which
<hi>Aliens</hi> have you in. The ſwaggering gallant perhaps ſcornes your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>Drunkards make ſongs</hi> upon you, all the world derides your profeſſion, reckoning you to be but as the offal and refuſe of all things.</p>
            <p>But what of all this, Chriſt accounteth more honourably of you, ſo honourably as that he holds not himſelfe compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you. If men have the favour and good oppinion of the Prince, they will contemne the ſnarling of the multitude.</p>
            <p>Why the King of the Church, the King of heaven and earth, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> highly loves, and honours you, eſteemes you as parts and portions of himſelfe, as parts of his
<hi>fulneſs.</hi> Me thinks then you ſhould extreamly ſlight whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Rakehels thinke, or ſay of you.</p>
            <p>I proceed unto the laſt relative conſideration of Chriſt. Laſtly<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168371:15"/>therefore he may be conſidered according to the relation he hath of a <hi>cauſe</hi> towards our ſalvation. And ſo there dwelleth in him a <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>office,</hi> and
<hi>authority,</hi> an <hi>all-fulneſs</hi> of <hi>ſufficiency</hi> to accompliſh it.</p>
            <p>1. An <hi>all-fulneſs</hi> of <hi>office</hi> and
<hi>authority:</hi> For the opening of which, I ſhall at large handle thoſe words, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me, in heaven,</hi> and
<hi>in earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here by <hi>power</hi> may be underſtood, either a
<hi>phyſical power of efficacy,</hi> or a <hi>moral power of authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A <hi>phyſical power of efficacy,</hi> and that is, ſay ſome, the <hi>omnipotency</hi> of his God-head, or elſe as others determine, a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power of his manhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Some take this <hi>all power</hi> for the <hi>omnipotency</hi> of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: and they are againe ſubdivided.</p>
            <p>1. Divers Orthodoxe writers affirme that <hi>omnipotency</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Chriſt, as he is the eternal Son of God.</p>

<hi>Aarons rod bloſſoming, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 217. 218. Undertaketh to prove this interpretation to be agreeable, as unto the analogy of faith, ſo alſo unto the coheſion and dependance of the words. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>being to give a commiſſion to the Apoſtles to go and preach the Goſpel to all nations, he firſt anticipateth a great objection, which might ariſe in the Apoſtles minds; they might<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168371:15"/>thinke, how ſhall we be able to carry the Goſpel through the nations? We ſhall have all the powers of the world againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To remove this fear he ſaid, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; as if he had ſaid; Doe you believe that I, who ſend you out, am the Son of the living God? Then know aſſuredly, that my divine power and ſoveraignty ſhall be for you, and I will ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule all the Kings, and Potentates, and States of the world, as may be moſt for my glory and your good; fear not therefore, but go, and preach to all nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author addeth, that all power in heaven and in earth may be ſaid to be given unto Chriſt, as he is the eternal Son of God, in another reſpect, namely, in reſpect of the <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thereof at his reſurrection. <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, by the reſurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.4.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe, he tels us, <hi>Gomarus,</hi> and others give in anſwer unto the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries,</hi> as alſo that they clear it by
<hi>Auguſtin's</hi> rule. <hi>Aliquid dicitur fieri, quando incipit patefieri.</hi> And this is no more ſtrange, then to ſay, <hi>That Chriſt was begotten that day, when he was raiſed from the dead,</hi> Act. 13.33.</p>
            <p>Unto both theſe interpretations I oppoſe theſe following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>1. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>2. A gift, to ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> is <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>arbitrary;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the communication of <hi>omnipotency</hi> unto the Son, by <hi>eternal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> is <hi>natural</hi> and
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> and therefore cannot be ſaid to be given, unleſs by a <hi>metaphor.</hi> And then as for manifeſtation of this
<hi>omnipitency</hi> by the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> that is ſaid to be a
<hi>donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thereof only <hi>metonymically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now why ſhould we hunt for tropes, as long as the words may fairly be interpreted in their native, and proper ſenſe.</p>
            <p>3. In all probability, the <hi>power</hi> that is here given unto Chriſt, is for it's general nature, the ſame, which in the following words he

            <p>In a ſecond place the <hi>Lutheraus</hi> hold that

            </p>
            <p>Now we grant a communication of <hi>omnipotency,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine properties unto the manhood, expreſſed <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretively.</hi> For we may truly, and ſafely ſay, the man Chriſt is omnipotent. But this communication of <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,</hi> is an immediate <hi>conſequent</hi> of the perſonal union, and therefore not the donation of all-power in heaven and earth, here ſpoken of: for this, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his humiliation, and a branch of his exaltation, <hi>his ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand of God,</hi> Luk. 24.26. Hebr. 1.3.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will not be ſatisfied, unleſs we yeeld unto them a communication of the <hi>omnipotency</hi> unto the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, expreſſed <hi>abſtractively.</hi> Unleſs we ſay, the manhood it ſelfe is omnipotent:</p>
            <p>And againſt ſuch a communication our <hi>Divines</hi> uſually oppoſe theſe following arguments.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> is a <hi>reciprocal</hi> property of the
<hi>Deity,</hi> and therefore incommunicable unto the humanity.</p>
            <p>For any one to averre that ſuch a property may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, is to ſay, that may be communicated, which is incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, then which what contradiction can be more groſs?</p>
            <p>Yea but ſaith <hi>Eckard,</hi> the divine properties are communicated to the humanity, not <hi>tranſitively,</hi> but
<hi>intranſitively,</hi> and if my<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168371:17"/>memory faile me not,
<hi>Martinus</hi> in lectures of his againſt <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kermans Legick,</hi> diſtinguiſheth of an <hi>inheſive,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> The divine properties are communicated, (ſaith he) not
<hi>inhaeſivè,</hi> but <hi>poſſeſſivè.</hi> I confeſs it was a long time ſince that I read the book, when I was a Boy. But I ſuppoſe, I am not miſtaken. But ſure I am that the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gerard deper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonâ &amp; officio Chriſti cap.</hi> 12.</note> generality of them hath the ſame thing for ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The Divine properties (ſay they) are communicated unto the manhood, not by any <hi>phyſical,</hi> and <hi>real transfuſion, or ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive inheſion;</hi> but by a <hi>real donation,</hi> by which the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties doe ſo become the attributes of the humanity, that it may freely uſe them.</p>
            <p>As for example, the divine <hi>omnipotency</hi> doth ſo become the <hi>omnipotency</hi> of the humane nature, as that it denominates the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature to be omnipotent; and the humane nature may work
<hi>omnipotently</hi> with it, no leſs then the divine nature doth it ſelfe. But all this is but gibberiſh, and unintelligible non-ſenſe, and I cannot find any tollerable explication of it, though I have diligently ſearcht for it in their bookes. And for reply unto it, I ſhall only ſay, that <hi>omnipotency</hi> is not an <hi>extrinſecal denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but an <hi>intrinſecal attribution,</hi> and therefore cannot
<hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> the manhood, without it were <hi>formally,</hi> and
<hi>actually</hi> in it; Even as it is impoſſible for the wall to be white by a whiteneſs that is not ſeated in it. Adde hereunto out of <hi>M. Bayne</hi> upon the <hi>Epheſians</hi> pag. 189. That this opinion touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of divine properties by way of <hi>real donation,</hi> maketh <hi>the divine properties become inſtrumentary faculties, as it were, to a finite nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>omnipotency</hi> is really the ſame with the eſſence of the God-head, and with all it's other attributes, particularly with it's <hi>ſimplicity, eternity,</hi> and <hi>infiniteneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of things which are really the ſame, one cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, without the other be imparted alſo. For otherwiſe, as my learned friend <hi>M. Barlow</hi> argueth againſt <hi>Gerard,</hi> in his
<hi>Exercit. Metaph.</hi> 6: it might come to paſs, that a thing might be communicated, when it is not communicated it ſelfe. If ſo be then
<hi>omnipotency</hi> be ſo communicated unto the manhood of Chriſt, as to denominate it <hi>in abſtracto</hi> omnipotent; Why then the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168371:17"/>very eſſence of the God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> head may be communicated alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to denominate it God; and all the other attributes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>eternity, ſimplicity, infiniteneſs</hi> may be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it in like manner; ſo that we may ſay of the manhood
<hi>abſtractively,</hi> it is ſimple, eternal, infinite.</p>
            <p>But now the moſt rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> will deny, that the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt is God, that it is of a ſimple, &amp; uncompounded being, from everlaſting, and infinite: and yet they may by equal
<hi>anology</hi> of reaſon ſay this, as well as they doe that it is omnipotent, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, omniſcient. <hi>D. Field</hi> in his fifth book of the Church, <hi>c.</hi> 15. minceth this horrid tenet of the
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> and ſpeaketh very favourably of it. <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that howſoever ſome of them have uſed harſh, doubtful, dangerous, and unbefitting formes of ſpeech, yet they differ not in meaning and judgment from the Orthodoxe and right believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which led this great Schollar into this miſtaken charity was his <hi>miſ-interpretation</hi> of that uſual ſaying of
<hi>Divines,</hi> that <hi>the ſubſiſtence</hi> of the Son of God is
<hi>really</hi> communicated unto the nature of man, in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But this communication of the <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> of the ſecond perſon unto the humanity is not (as <hi>Baron: philoſophia. Theol. Ancil. Artic.</hi> 12: and after him <hi>M. Barlow</hi> in the forementioned place, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellently ſhew) by way of <hi>real inheſion,</hi> or
<hi>denomination,</hi> but only <hi>by way of ſuſtentation:</hi> And this is no advantage unto the <hi>Lutherans</hi> communication of divine properties.</p>
            <p>Look as when a <hi>ſubject</hi> doth communicate it ſelfe unto it's <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> by way of <hi>ſupport,</hi> it doth not hereupon follow, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth in them, or doth denominate them. So though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne doe aſſume, receive, and ſuſtaine the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, yet it doth not hereupon follow, that the
<hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence</hi> of the Sonne is <hi>formally</hi> in the

               </gap>hood, or that the manhood is a perſon, as is proved at large by thoſe two men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Authours.</p>
            <p>2. Others in the next place underſtand the words, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a
<hi>phyſical power</hi> of the manhood; But theſe I ſhall confute, when I come to examine what <hi>fulneſs</hi> of power dwelleth in the manhood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, you ſee the place is to be underſtood concerning a <hi>moral power,</hi> a power of Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:168371:18"/>Now there agreeth unto Chriſt a twofold
<hi>power of Authority, eſſential,</hi> and <hi>official.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Eſſential</hi> or <hi>natural,</hi> which belongs unto him as God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.1,2: and 95.3. and 22.28. and 59.13. and
103.19. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34,35.</p>
            <p>Now this is common unto the Father, and Holy Ghoſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him; and is <hi>poteſtas innata,</hi> not <hi>data,</hi> therefore not here meant.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Official, diſpenſative,</hi> or <hi>donative,</hi> delegated unto him, as Mediatour, and head of his Church, and therefore termed a <hi>mediatory power,</hi> and this is the power ſpoken of in this place.</p>
            <p>But now ſay our <hi>Divines</hi> againſt the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> Chriſt is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour according unto both natures, not only as man, but as God, and man.</p>
            <p>The divine authority then of Chriſt is mediatory, not as it is
<hi>common</hi> unto every perſon in the Trinity, but as it is
<hi>appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> unto him, the ſecond perſon. Thus ſpeakes the learned and pious <hi>Bayne</hi> on the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> pag. 187.
<hi>This perſon as God recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by voluntary diſpenſation this honour from the Father, that he ſhould in an immediate, and appropriate manner, execute govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all the creatures in heaven and earth:</hi> And again
<hi>pag.</hi> 183. <hi>So that though the Father and Spirit have a right and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the creature, yet they doe not immediately execute this, in ſuch ſort, as the Son doth; which maketh Chriſt ſay,</hi> Joh. 5.22.
<hi>The Father judgeth none, but hath given all judgment unto the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now it may be objected, that as every perſon executeth government over all creatures both in heaven, and earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an outward worke of the Trinity, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto every perſon; ſo alſo they doe it in an immediate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>immediatione tum ſuppoſiti, tum virtutis,</hi> as all divine works are done; and therefore Chriſt's execution of the ſoveraigne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God over every creature
<hi>immediately,</hi> makes nothing unto the appropriation of this ſoveraigne dominion unto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>A ſolution of this doubt you may gather from what <hi>D. Field</hi> pag. 43. anſwereth unto a like objection, againſt his being a mediatour according unto both natures concurring in the work of mediation; His words I ſhall inſert at large.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:168371:18"/>
               <hi>If it be alleadged, that opera Trinitatis ad extra are indiviſa,</hi> that is, <hi>that there is nothing that one of the perſons of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth towards the creatures, but they all doe it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoſe things which Chriſt did in his divine nature, pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to the office of a Mediatour, being common to all the perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer, <hi>that as the perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, though they be one and the ſame God, yet differ

                  </gap>, in ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and the manner of having, and poſſeſſing the Deity, and divine nature; ſo though their action be the ſame, and the work done by them, yet they differ
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the manner of doing it: for the Father doth all things</hi> authoritativè, <hi>and the Son</hi> ſubautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritativè, <hi>as the School-men ſpeak;</hi> that is,
<hi>the Father, as he from whom, and of whom all things are; the Son, as he</hi> by <hi>whom all things are, not as if he were an inſtrument, but as</hi> principium à principio, <hi>that is, a cauſe and beginning of things, that hath received the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence it hath, and power of working from another, though the very ſame that is in the other. And in this ſort to quicken, give life, and to impart the ſpirit of ſanctification to whom he pleaſeth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a kind of concurring of the humane nature, meriting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, and inſtrumentally aſſiſting, is proper to the Son of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in our fleſh, and not common to the whole Trinity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, notwithſtanding the objection taken from the unity of the works of the divine perſons, may be a worke of mediation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe words he layeth down two grounds of the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of workes of divine power and authority to Chriſt, as a Mediatour.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his, both
<hi>ſubſiſting,</hi> and <hi>working;</hi> but this, if I miſtake not, is impertinent, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory unto the Objection. For it would have agreed unto him as the Sonne of God, if he had never been Mediatour.</p>
            <p>But the ſecond ground, the <hi>inſtrumental concurrence of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature,</hi> commeth home, and fully ſatisfieth the doubt.</p>
            <p>For though all the perſons have an immediate influence upon all works of divine power, and Authority; yet the Sonne only produceth ſuch of them at leaſt, as relate unto his Church by the <hi>inſtrumental aſſociation,</hi> and concurrence of his manhood, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united with him.</p>
            <p>To performe them ſimply as <hi>God,</hi> is common to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168371:19"/>To performe them as <hi>God man,</hi> is appropriate to Chriſt as Mediatour. As aſcribed unto him, they are, ſay
<hi>Divines; Theandrical,</hi> that is, divinely humane. And this occaſioneth me to interpret that place alleadged by <hi>M. Bayne,</hi> John: 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Father judgeth no man in the ſame ſenſe, that it is committed unto the Son; now it is committed unto the Son, as he is
<hi>Mediatour,</hi> God <hi>incarnate,</hi> God <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the forme of a ſervant,</hi> that is, the nature of a man; and thus the Father judgeth no man. Thus

            <p>But this appropriation of Divine authority unto Chriſt, is not this donation of all power unto him in heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>For that (as you may ſee in <hi>D. Feild</hi> pag. 434.) is an
<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate conſequent</hi> of the perſonal union: Whereas this is a

For from hence I thus argue, Chriſt was ſet at the right hand of God, in regard of the ſame nature, wherein he was raiſed from the dead: But it was his humane nature that was rayſed from the dead; and therefore it was in reſpect of that, that he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the right hand of God; and conſequently, unto that <hi>all power was given in heaven and earth.</hi> That ſhall be the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which hence I ſhall purſue.</p>

               <note place="margin">

               </note>
               <hi>All mediatory power was diſpenſed unto Chriſt's huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity after it's reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall explain, confirme, and apply.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Explication:</hi> Chriſt's power of Authority as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, is twofold. 1. <hi>Special,</hi> over his Church. 2.
<hi>General,</hi> not only in the Church, but out of the Church, over all creatures in heaven and in earth.</p>
            <p>1. Then, Chriſt as Mediatour hath a <hi>ſpecial</hi> and
<hi>direct power,</hi> over his Church. And that this power is comprized in the text, though not only, is agreed unto on all hands. Concerning it, we have in the Text theſe particulars remarkable.</p>
            <p>1. The kind. 2. The cauſe, or original. 3. The fulneſs, or extent of it.</p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>kind of it,</hi> it is a <hi>ſpiritual power</hi> over the ſoules and conſciences of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. <hi>Rom.</hi>
14.17.</p>
            <p>2. For the <hi>Original of it,</hi> it is <hi>given,</hi> and that in a twofold ſenſe.</p>
            <p>1. It is <hi>data,</hi> or <hi>diſpenſatoria,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>ingenita,</hi> or <hi>nativa;</hi> it is not a
<hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>donative, diſpenſatory,</hi> or <hi>delegated power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:168371:20"/>2. It is <hi>data,</hi> in oppoſition to
<hi>rapta;</hi> it is <hi>given,</hi> not <hi>uſurpt,</hi> therefore a juſt and lawful power.</p>
            <p>3. Next, we have the <hi>fulneſs</hi> or <hi>extent</hi> of it, and that 1. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal.</hi> 2. <hi>Extrinſecal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Intrinſecal,</hi> He hath all <hi>ſorts,</hi> and
<hi>kinds</hi> of ſpiritual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the <hi>Prophetical, Prieſtly,</hi> and
<hi>Kingly</hi> power.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Extrinſecal.</hi> His power as Mediatour, extendeth unto all places. <hi>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth:</hi> In heaven the Church <hi>Triumphant;</hi> in earth the Church
<hi>Militant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he hath power to diſtribute grace, there he hath power to conferre glory.</p>
            <p>Unto theſe particulars expreſſed in the text, I ſhall adde the <hi>limitation,</hi> or <hi>reſtriction</hi> of this power, in regard of
<hi>time;</hi> and that 1. in regard of it's <hi>firſt collation.</hi> 2. in reſpect of it's <hi>whole duration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In regard of it's <hi>firſt collation.</hi> Our Saviour (ſaith <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi>) ſo ſpeakes, as if he had not this power before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: For he ſpeakes as of a new matter. <hi>Now</hi> all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>now</hi> I give you your full commiſſion; <hi>Goe ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> And for this he quotes <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now this is to be underſtood, not ſo much concerning his
<hi>commiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> in it ſelfe, as of the
<hi>plenary execution thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lyra.</hi> Although Chriſt, (ſaith he) as man, from the very firſt moment of his conception had power in heaven and earth
<hi>authoritativè;</hi> yet he had it not <hi>executivè,</hi> before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>The Baptiſme of Chriſt was (as you may ſee in
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Theol. med. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi>

               <hi>Ames</hi>) his publique inauguration to the publique performance of his office.</p>
            <p>Therefore in it, as he there ſheweth at large, the three offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt are affirmed, and confirmed.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this, there was an
<hi>enlargement</hi> of all his offices, after his reſurrection, <hi>in point of execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus firſt, there was an enlargement of his <hi>Prophetical office.</hi> The firſt commiſſion that he opened unto his Apoſtles, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to goe to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and to refraine the<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168371:20"/>way of the Gentiles, and the Cities of the Samaritans,</hi> Math. 10.5,6.</p>
            <p>But now he enlargeth their commiſſion, and commands them to diſciple, <hi>baptize,</hi> and teach all <hi>nations.</hi> Beſides, by his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inſtruments, he hath compleated the rule of our faith, and manners, not only in reſpect of <hi>eſſentials,</hi> for ſo it was before, but alſo in regard of all it's <hi>integral parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There was an enlargement of his <hi>Prieſtly office;</hi> for now he interced's not ſo much in an <hi>oral,</hi> as in a <hi>real way,</hi> not in the humble poſture of a ſupplyant, as it were with bended knees,
<hi>with ſtrong cryings, and teares,</hi> as in the dayes of his humiliation,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. But in an <hi>Authoritative way,</hi> gloriouſly repreſenting unto his Father thoſe things, which he hath done and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his Elect. When we ſay, that Chriſt now interced's in a
<hi>way of Authority,</hi> our meaning is not, that he hath <hi>authority to command</hi> the Father: For, to affirme that, were blaſphemy; but that he hath a <hi>right</hi> unto whatſoever he interced's for, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amply merited it at the hands of his Father, ſo that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion is
<hi>virtute pretii,</hi> in vertue of the price that he hath paid, and purchaſe that he hath made, in the behalfe of all the Elect.</p>
            <p>3. There was after his reſurrection an enlargement of his
<hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office,</hi> in poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>f execution.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>inſtitution</hi> of all <hi>ordinances,</hi> and all
<hi>offices</hi> in his Church, or Kingdome, whether <hi>extraordinary,</hi> or
<hi>ordinary,</hi> was fully compleated, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11,12,13. During his forty dayes converſe with his Apoſtles after his reſurrection, he
<hi>ſpake with them of the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God,</hi> Acts. 1.3. And then doubtleſs gave them full directions for his worſhip, as alſo for the preſent, and future government of his Church; and ſhortly afterwards he powred on them miraculous gifts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ſpirit, to qualifie them for the propagation of his Goſpel or Kingdome.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>borders</hi> of his <hi>Kingdome</hi> were enlarged; for before they were confined unto <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 76.1,2: and ſuch few <hi>Proſelites</hi> as joyned themſelves unto the communion of that Church; but now he hath the <hi>heathen for his inheritance, the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2.8: <hi>the Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord and his Chriſt,</hi> Revel. 11.15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:168371:21"/>2. We have a <hi>limitation</hi> or
<hi>reſtriction</hi> of this power, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the time of it's whole
<hi>duration.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24. <hi>When the end commeth, then he ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to God, even the Father:</hi> that is, he ſhall ſurrender up to his Father his <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory power,</hi> and
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> which he now adminiſtreth, and which he received for the gathering, protection, and ſalvation of his Church, and ſubduing of all his, and our enemies. And this is all that I ſhall ſay at preſent, touching Chriſts ſpecial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Authority, that he hath in his Church. Divers are of the opinion, as you may ſee in <hi>M. Gilleſpies Aarons rod bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming,</hi> pag. 214, 215, that this only is the <hi>all-power</hi> meant in the text: But I rather incline unto thoſe, that underſtand it in ſuch an extent, as that it takes in his <hi>general Authority, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> or <hi>dominion,</hi> that he hath as man, over the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe: For 1. this expoſition containes a truth in it ſelfe, as I ſhall make good in the proof of the point.</p>
            <p>2. It is the more <hi>comprehenſive</hi> ſenſe, and includes the former.</p>
            <p>And 3. It makes moſt to the advancement of Chriſt's glory, and honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And 4. The ſame thing is aſſerted in places, that are by the conſent of moſt, that treat of this ſubject, paralel unto this: as
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20,21,22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9,10,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that there is nothing of moment in the context againſt this interpretation.</p>
            <p>There be ſeveral objections I confeſs, againſt this
<hi>univerſal dominion</hi> of Chriſt, as man; but they will vaniſh, when once I ſhall have explained it by it's <hi>end,</hi> by a
<hi>diſtribution</hi> of it, by the <hi>extent,</hi> and laſtly by the
<hi>manner</hi> of it's influence.</p>
            <p>To begin then 1. with the <hi>end of this univerſal authority:</hi> We have it briefly expreſſed in <hi>D. Ames Med. lib.</hi>
1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>n.</hi> 22. Chriſt's Kingdome is univerſal, in reſpect of all creatures, as they doe in any ſort pertaine to the
<hi>furthering,</hi> or <hi>beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of mens ſalvation. And it may be made good out of <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many, as thou haſt given him.</hi> That diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>direct</hi> and
<hi>indirect</hi> power, which is miſ-applied by <hi>Papiſts</hi> unto the
<hi>Pope,</hi> may rightly be applied unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>His power <hi>directly</hi> is only over <hi>ſpirituals</hi> in his Church; but<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168371:21"/>he hath authority over <hi>temporals</hi> out of his Church, over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in heaven and earth,
<hi>indirectly,</hi> and, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in ſubſerviency unto his ends about his Church.</p>
            <p>To proceed 2. unto a <hi>diſtribution of this power.</hi> There is one branch of it <hi>abſolutely generall,</hi> which regards all creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, &amp; that is Authority of <hi>diſpoſal, uſe, or application.</hi> Chriſt, as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> can doe unto, and diſpoſe of all creatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him.</p>
            <p>There is 2. Another, that is <hi>General only reſpectively,</hi> in ſuch a kind, over all <hi>rational</hi> creatures, and that is a
<hi>judiciary power. The Father hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. Act. 17.31. &amp; here give me leave to tranſcribe an excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of <hi>Ames Med. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 41. <hi>Num.</hi>

1. cap. 41. Num. 20.21.</note> 
               <hi>The laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exerciſed by Chriſt, as by a King: for the power of judging is part of the office of a King. In reſpect of the faithful it comes from grace, and is an office of the kingdome of grace, eſſential to Chriſt, the Mediatour: but in reſpect of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, it is an office of power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dominion, granted of the Father, belonging to ſome perfection of mediation; but not eſſential to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A third thing remarkable touching this his univerſal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as Mediatour, is <hi>the extent of it's influence.</hi> It is not over all motions, and actions of all creatures whatſoever at all times, but only <hi>in caſu,</hi> when he in his wiſedome judgeth any of them ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, &amp; contributary unto his Church deſignes. And his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head doubtleſs revealeth unto his manhood in it's glorified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition all the exigences of his Church, and how, and wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the creatures may be ſubſervient to the true good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the manifeſtation of his own, and his Father's glory. I do not think, that every clap of thunder, every flaſh of lightning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſhowre of rain is a fruit of Chriſt's
<hi>mediatory authority.</hi> Yet I am verily perſwaded, that the thunder &amp; lightning, that daſht the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> and that abundant rain, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh't the army of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> which was ready to periſh for thirſt, upon the prayers of the Chriſtian Legion in the army, that was afterwards for this ſurnamed the <hi>thundering Legion,</hi> proceeded from Chriſt, as he was a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,</hi> Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 4 cap. 5. <hi>In the time of the maſſacre at Paris, there was a poor man, who for his deliverance, crept into a hole,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168371:22"/>and when he was there, there comes a ſpider, and weaves a cobweb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hole; when the murderers came to ſearch for him, ſaith one, certainly he is got into that hole: no, ſaith another, he cannot be there, for there is a cobweb over the place, and by this means the poore man was preſerved.</hi> Spiders webs have ſeldome relation unto the deſignes of Chriſt, as Mediatour; Yet, I believe in charity, that this poor man did aſcribe this ſpiders web, which was extraordinarily inſtrumental in his preſervation, unto the gratious, powerful, and authoritative mediation of his Saviour Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>When the Proteſtants attempted to relieve Leyden beſiedged by the Spaniards, behold a great South weſt wind (which they might truly ſay came from the grace of God (for it was upon the extremity of their affaires) with ſo great a Springtide as in eight &amp; forty houres the water was riſen about halfe a foot, by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were enabled to come unto the relief of the towne. The towne was no ſooner delivered, but the wind, which was ſouth-weſt, and had driven the waters out of the ſea into the country, turned to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and did drive it back againe into the ſea, as if the South-weſt wind had not blown thoſe three dayes but to that effect. Wherefore they might well ſay, that both the wind, and the ſeas had fought for the towne of Leyden.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I ſuppoſe that every ſpirit amongſt them, that was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian, did look upon this motion of the ſea, and wind, and their deliverance thereby, not only as an <hi>effect of common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> but as a mercy comming out of the hands of a Loving Mediatour, whom God for the good of his Choſen hath made his <hi>Lievtenant,</hi> and <hi>Vice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roy</hi> over all nature, unto whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the moſt boyſterous winds, and the moſt tempeſtuous ſeas are obedient.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I propounded for explication of this
<hi>univerſal dominion,</hi> or <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> of Chriſt, as
<hi>man,</hi> is the <hi>manner of it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> which I ſhall only mention. It is not <hi>phyſical,</hi> for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Chriſt's manhood being in heaven to have a <hi>phyſical influence</hi> upon every occurrence in the earth, relating unto his Church and glory,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. But only <hi>moral,</hi> by way of interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Aske of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If Chriſt, as <hi>man,</hi> but aske of the Father, all creatures ſhall be<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168371:22"/>ſubject to him, and he ſhall doe to them, and fulfil upon them, <hi>all the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> Math. 26.53.</p>
            <p>Here comes in that Queſtion, whether or no <hi>the power of the temporal Magiſtrate, as ſuch be ſo derived from Chriſt, not only as God, but as Mediatour, ſo that he is his Deputy, and Vicegerent.</hi> The neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tive may be made good by theſe following arguments.</p>
            <p>1. The power of Chriſt's Deputies, as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> is only <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial,</hi> the power of ſervants or Hera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lds, (not counted <hi>Luk.</hi>
22.25,26. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.25,26,27: as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> prove againſt
<hi>Papiſts</hi> in the controverſy touching the <hi>ſupremacy of the Pope.</hi> But now the power of magiſtrates may be <hi>imperial,</hi> and
<hi>monarchical,</hi> and therefore it is not derived from Chriſt, as he is
<hi>Mediatour,</hi> unto his Deputies.</p>
            <p>2. All the Deputies and Vice-gerents of Chriſt, as Mediatour, are obliged to promote the Kingdome and Goſpel of Chriſt. But now heatheniſh magiſtrates, that never heard, nor could hear of the name of Chriſt, are not bound to promote Chriſt's mediatory kingdome, and goſpel: for they are invincibly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof, and there can be no obligation without revelation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. Therefore they are not the Deputies, and Vice-gerents of Chriſt, as Mediatour; and therefore no magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates as <hi>ſuch:</hi> for, <hi>à quatenus ad de omni valet conſequentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. All the Deputies, and Vice-gerents of Chriſt, as Mediatour have their commiſſion from the Goſpel: but now temporal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have their commiſſion at leaſt from the <hi>ſecondary Law</hi> of nature, the Law of nations.

277, 278. I confeſs <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> quotes a ſhort paſſage for the oppoſite opinion out of <hi>Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi> His <hi>due right of Presbyteries,</hi> and withall tels us, that it was <hi>Mr. Rutherford's</hi> judgment upon ſecond thoughts, which uſually are the wiſeſt. Whether they were his ſecond thoughts I cannot determine, but ſure I am, if the titles of the bookes doe not deceive me, that <hi>the Divine right of Church-government,</hi> which I uſe for the <hi>negative,</hi> was printed
1646. And the <hi>due right of divine Presbyteries,</hi> which he quotes for the <hi>affirmative,</hi> beares date 1644. Beſides, in his <hi>due right of Presbyteries,</hi> he ſpeaks of the matter only <hi>incidenter,</hi> upon the by, and very briefly, in a very few lines, and not ſo clearly, and fully home unto the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative,</hi> as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> pretends. Whereas in his
<hi>divine right of Church government,</hi> he handles the queſtion <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth for the <hi>negative,</hi> and ſpendeth forty pages in the proof and clearing of it.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more, and I have done with the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the point. How can this general authority, ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and dominion, be ſaid to accrue unto him upon his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing <hi>the government was upon his ſhoulders when he was a child,</hi> I ſai. 9.6. <hi>He was from his conception anointed with the Holy Ghoſt, and power,</hi> Acts.
10.38. <hi>He was borne, and conceived heire of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer,</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>his title unto,</hi> and his <hi>plenary and glorious poſſeſſion, and exerciſe of this Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had a <hi>title unto</hi> it from the very firſt moment of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But <hi>the plenary and glorious poſſeſſion and exerciſe of it,</hi> was deferred until his exaltation. Indeed the greateſt and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt act of it will be at the day of judgment, when he ſhall put down all rule, and all authority, and power, when he <hi>ſhall put all enemies vnder his feet,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24,25.</p>
            <p>1. He took not a full, glorious, and viſible poſſeſſion of it, until his exaltation. His aſeenſion day was his <hi>coronation day;</hi> and the Father's ſetting of him at his right hand, was the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him on his throne.</p>
            <p>2. There were ſome <hi>initial actings</hi> of this univerſal ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in miracles, which he wrought in his ſtate of humiliation.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168371:23"/>But in his exaltation the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it may be ſaid tobe enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in reference both unto his <hi>Church,</hi> and unto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>1. In reference unto <hi>his Church.</hi> In his humiliation, he exerciſed it only in reference unto the Jewiſh Church, and ſuch Proſelytes as adjoyned themſelves thereunto. But now he exerciſeth it in order unto his Catholique Church diſperſed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively through all the world.</p>
            <p>2. In reference unto himſelfe. In his humiliation he was ſo farre from actually fully reigning over all creatures, as that he voluntarily ſubjected himſelfe unto the annoyance, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of many of them: But now in his exaltation is become impaſſible, and ſo beyond the reach and aſſaults of the whole creation. No creature in heaven, earth, or hell, can hurt, or annoy him.</p>
            <p>To proceed next unto the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the point; and here <hi>I</hi> ſhall prove 1. <hi>That Chriſt had this fulneſs of authority, all power in heaven and earth given unto him.</hi> 2. <hi>That it was a conſequent of his reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That he had this <hi>fulneſs of Authority, All power in heaven and earth given unto him,</hi> and that 1. <hi>Specially, in the Church.</hi> 2. <hi>Generally not only in, but alſo out of the Church,</hi> over the whole Univerſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of proofes ſhall be to prove, that Chriſt hath a <hi>fulneſs of Authority over his Church,</hi> and they ſhall runne
1. in a <hi>general</hi> way. 2. more <hi>particularly,</hi> concerning each of his offices apart.</p>
            <p>1. To begin with thoſe proofes, which ſpeake of the fulneſs of Chriſt's office and authority in <hi>a general way.</hi> He is called,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>The Apoſtle, and High-prieſt of our profeſſion:</hi> to ſhew that he hath encloſed in his office the eminency, the perfection, and dignity of the higheſt callings, the chief offices, both in the old and new Teſtament, both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church: for the <hi>High-prieſt-hood</hi> was the higheſt office in the old Teſtament and Jewiſh Church, and the <hi>Apoſt leſhip</hi> was the higheſt office in the new Teſtament, or Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Chriſt alſo in regard of this his fulneſs of office is compared unto the <hi>chief corner ſtone in a building,</hi> Pſal. 118.22. Math. 21.42.<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168371:24"/>Acts. 4.11. Epheſ. 2.20. <hi>unto a foundation,</hi> Iſai. 28.16 Which place is by St. <hi>Peter</hi> applied unto Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. Every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone in a building contributes more unto the ſupport there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then other ordinary ſtones. Whereupon the rulers, and chief of a people, are ſtiled in ſcripture
<hi>their corners,</hi> 1. Sam. 14.38. Iſai. 19.13. Zech. 10.4. <hi>But now Chriſt is the head of the corner, or the chief corner ſtone;</hi> that is, the ground ſtone, the <hi>foundation, in whom all the building fitly framed together g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> As the ground ſtone in the corner, becauſe it beares up the joynts, &amp; couplings of the whole edifice, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chief ſtay thereof. So Chriſt upholds the chief weight of his Church, becauſe he is a prop unto the ſalvation of every ſoule therein, as a
<hi>Prophet</hi> by his word, as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> by the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and merit of his ſacrifice, and by his conſtant, and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted preſentation thereof unto his Father in his interceſſion, and as a
<hi>King</hi> by his power and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But now the chief corner ſtone, though it be a <hi>foundation ſtone,</hi> yet it is but a <hi>part,</hi> though a principal part of the foundation.</p>
            <p>But now Chriſt is not only a <hi>principal,</hi> but the
<hi>total, ſole, and entire foundation of his Church;</hi> that is, of her ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11: <hi>for other foundations can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts. 4.12.</p>
            <p>Yea but the Prophets and Apoſtles are at leaſt a
<hi>ſecondary and miniſterial foundation. Ye are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20.</p>
            <p>But 1. Some here by <hi>foundation</hi> underſtand Chriſt himſelfe, who is ſaid to be the <hi>foundation of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, the fundamental object</hi> of their doctrine, the foundation, which they laid in their miniſtry both by preaching and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe 2. that theſe words, the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles be, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſaith, expounded
<hi>intranſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and thus paraphraſed: <hi>which is the Prophets, and Apoſtles.</hi> Why then the Prophets and Apoſtles are taken not in regard of their perſons, or ſucceſſours, but <hi>metonymically</hi> in regard of their doctrine, which they left behind them in ſcripture: for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168371:24"/>they declared it with ſuch infallible certainty, as that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church a doctrinal foundation, and ſerveth as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay every Believer on the <hi>perſonal foundation</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>But 2. I ſhall prove the ſulneſs of each of his offices,
<hi>his Prophetical,</hi> his <hi>Prieſtly, his Kingly office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There was in him a fulneſs of the Prophetical office,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>He is the Angel,</hi> or meſſenger of the Covenant; to wit, of grace, and reconciliation: the chief Ambaſſadour from the Father, for the revelation, offer, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof unto the Church.</p>
            <p>He is the <hi>Apoſtle of our profeſſion;</hi> the Goſpel, Chriſtian doctrine, faith, or Religion, which we profeſs: and he is ſo tearmed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe he is the ſupreame of all the Ambaſſadours, whom his Father hath ſent for the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof. Thus alſo is he tearmed by way of eminency <hi>the faithful and true witneſs,</hi> Revel. 3.14: Becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath fully and effectually revealed the truth and will of God by himſelfe and his miniſters. He is the <hi>word</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he alone hath fully diſcloſed his mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Math.</hi> 23.8,10. <hi>One is your maſter, even Chriſt,</hi> he only teacheth with authority and efficacy, and therefore he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath the maſterſhip amongſt all the teachers of the Church, between whom there is a brotherhood, and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. One is your-maſter, Chriſt, and all yee are Brethren. No Teacher is an under maſter unto other Teachers.</p>
            <p>One part of Chriſt's <hi>paſtoral office,</hi> is his
<hi>Prophetical office,</hi> to feed his ſheep with the ſound and ſaving doctrine of his word, to <hi>make them to lie down in green paſtures, to lead them beſide the ſtill waters,</hi> Pſal. 23.2.</p>
            <p>And the paſtoral office agreeth unto him in all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'He is <hi>the one ſhepherd,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.11. <hi>The chief ſhepherd,</hi>
1 Pet. 5.4: <hi>The great ſhepherd of the ſheep,</hi> Hebr. 13.20.</p>
            <p>2. There was in Chriſt a fulneſs of the Prieſtly office, ſuch an unſpeakable ſuperexcellency of Prieſthood, as is incommunicable unto any other of the Sonnes of men.<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168371:25"/>And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſtileth him <hi>emphatically a great high Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 4.14: <hi>an High Prieſt of good things to come,</hi> chap. 9. verſ. 11: <hi>an High Prieſt over the howſe of God,</hi> chap.
10. verſ. 21: <hi>the High Prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 1: <hi>a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech,</hi> Heb,
7.17: <hi>he hath</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Heb.
7.24: <hi>an intranſmiſſible Prieſthood, which paſſeth not from one unto another,</hi> as it is varied in the margent; which cannot paſs from his own perſon unto any Succeſſours, or Vicars, and Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>3. And laſtly, there was in him <hi>a fulneſs of the Kingly office. The government,</hi> to wit, of the Church, <hi>ſhall be upon his ſhoulder,</hi> Iſai. 9.6: and that this Government is ſupreame, and regal, is plaine by <hi>verſ.</hi> 7: where it is deſcribed to be <hi>upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdome. He is the Lord of the vine-yard,</hi> Math. 21.40. He is in his howſe not as a <hi>Servant,</hi> but as <hi>a Sonne:</hi> that is, as <hi>Lord, and maſter,</hi> Hebr. 3.5,6.
<hi>He is the King of Saints,</hi> Revel. 15.3. <hi>He is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, the great Prince, which ſtandeth for the Children of his people,</hi> Dan. 12.1. and
7.14. <hi>Chriſt is the Lord of all,</hi> Acts. 10.36: that is, as appeares by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, of all, that in every nation <hi>feare God, and worke righteouſneſs.</hi> He is the Lord, as of all <hi>perſons,</hi> ſo of all ordinances in his Church. <hi>The Sonne of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day,</hi> Math. 12.8. <hi>All things are dilivered unto me of my Father,</hi> Math. 11.27: that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> reſtraines the place, all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining unto the ſalvation of the Elect: And indeed this his reſtriction is warrantable by the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which he brings for examplification of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Sonne, and he to whomſoever the Sonne will reveale him.</hi> The Sonne only hath delegated unto him from the Father authority to call and enlighten the Elect, and reveale the Father unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:168371:25"/>This fullneſſe of Chriſts Kingly office, is ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his Head-ſhip over his Church: for as head he hath ſuch a full influence upon his Church <hi>internall,</hi> and
<hi>externall,</hi> as that he needeth no viceroy, no miniſteriall, or viſible head on earth. And that to be head of the Church, is a dignity proper unto Chriſt, and incommunicable unto any other, the incomparable
<hi>Cartwright</hi> proves, as by others, ſo eſpecially by theſe two following arguments, in <hi>his confutation of the Rhemiſt annotations on the New Teſtament. pag.</hi> 487.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By the ſame reaſon, that you may give this title of head unto a meere Man, you may alſo give him the name of the firſt begotten of all creatures, and the firſt begotten of the dead: conſidering, that the Apoſtle faſtneth this unto the Crowne of our Saviour Chriſt, as well as he doth the other. Col.</hi> 1.15,18.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>This is further ſtrengthned, by the demonſtrative Article, whereby the Scripture is accuſtomed ſo to appropriate a thing unto one, that it ſhutteth forth all other from communication therewith: for when he ſaith, that he is the head, it is as much, as if he would ſay, he and none other, Col.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>This fullneſſe of Chriſt's Kingly office is further ſignified, by his power of the keyes.

Now what proofs we have for the fulneſſe, and perfection of Chriſt's paſtorall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, you may read above, touching his Propheticall office.</p>
            <p>I come unto a ſecond ſort of proofes, that confirme Chriſt's Fulneſſe of Authority as Mediatour, as man, not only in, but alſo out of his Church, his <hi>

               <hi>John</hi> 5.22. <hi>The father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the ſonne:</hi> that is, ſay ſome, he hath committed unto him all kingly power, power to governe the world, and to diſpoſe of all things therein: for judgment by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> may ſtand for the whole duty of a king; and conſequently, <hi>judiciary power</hi> by the like trope, may be put for all the power of a king.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Jeſus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God. Cajetan</hi> amongſt thoſe <hi>all things</hi> comprizeth the Devill, the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> and every machination of the Jewes againſt Chriſt: And that this ſoveraignty over all things agreeth here unto Chriſt as man, is evident from the following words, where we have two grounds of it. 1. His
<hi>incarnation,</hi> that he <hi>was come from God.</hi> 2. His
<hi>exaltation,</hi> that was at hand; <hi>and went to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chiefeſt creatures in heaven, and the chiefeſt creatures in earth, are not exempted from his dominion: for the chiefeſt in heaven are the Angels, and he <hi>is the head of all principalities, and dominion, Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Angels are made ſubject unto him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3.22. The chiefeſt creatures in earth are men; and his dominion exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto all men. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, Joh.</hi> 17.2. Where by all fleſh is underſtood all men, and ſo it is frequently uſed in Scripture. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. The moſt renowned, and glorious of all the ſonnes of men are potentates, the Kings, and Princes of the earth, and even they are ſubject unto his diſpoſall, however they may reſiſt his commands. He is <hi>the Prince of the kings of the earth, Revel.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He hath on his veſture, and on his thigh, a name written, King of kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> chapt. 19. v. 16. <hi>and</hi>
17.14. He can prevaile with his father, for the depoſing, uncrowning, and dethroning of whom he pleaſeth, for the propagation of the Goſpell: he can depreſſe a<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168371:27"/>
               <hi>Maxencius,</hi> and a <hi>Licinius,</hi> and raiſe a <hi>Conſtantine</hi> unto the Imperiall throne. But this his Authority reacheth unto more powerfull Princes, then any earthly Monarch whatſoever, unto death, <hi>the king of terrors, Job.</hi> 18.14. unto
<hi>Beelzebub</hi> the <hi>prince of Devils, Math.</hi> 9.34. <hi>the prince and God of this world, John.</hi> 14.30. <hi>and</hi> 16.11.2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4.4. <hi>the prince of the power of the aire, Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>For he hath the keyes of Hell, and death, Revel.</hi> 1.18. He hath the keyes of hell:
<hi>he can caſt the Dragon, that old ſerpent, the Devill, and Satan, into the bottomleſſe pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeale upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand yeers ſhould be fulfilled, Rev.</hi> 20.3. He hath the keyes of death, and one day will unlock the graves of all men.</p>
            <p>In a ſecond place, we are to prove, that Chriſt's
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>all-power</hi> that was given to him in heaven and in earth, was a conſequent of his reſurrection, and this I ſhall make good by foure places of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt is; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20,21,22. Where we have Chriſts, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authority, or dominion ſet forth unto us <hi>a comparatis, ab object o principalitatis</hi> or <hi>perfectionis,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>a diſtributione.</hi> 1. <hi>By a compariſon of ſimilitude.</hi> 2. <hi>By the chiefe objects of it.</hi> 3. <hi>By a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A comparatis,</hi> by a compariſon of ſimilitude. It is as it were a placing of him at <hi>Gods owne right hand in the heavenly places, v.</hi> 20. <hi>At the right hand of majeſty on high, Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>at the right hand of the throne of God, Heb.</hi> 12.2. For what is this his ſitting at the right hand of God, but the higheſt degree of his exaltation, whereby he enjoyeth the higheſt glory of his mediation, and that is
<hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> a kingly glory; which doth alſo redound unto other of his offices, ſo that he exerciſeth <hi>a kingly prieſthood,</hi> and a <hi>kingly prophecy,</hi> as you may ſee in
<hi>Ames. Med. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Num.</hi> 32, 33, 34. The phraſe is <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> in alluſion to the cuſtome of great potentates, who placed at the right hand of their thrones, their moſt inward and powerfull favourites; or their heires, and ſucceſſors; or ſuch great perſons as were next in dignity, and office unto them. <hi>Solomon</hi> to honour his mother ſeated her <hi>on his right hand,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the kings right hand did ſtand the Queene in gold of Ophir, Pſalm.</hi> 45.9. When the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children deſired that her ſonnes <hi>might ſit the one on<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168371:27"/>the right hand, and the other on the left hand of Chriſt, in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> what did ſhe crave, but the two chiefe dignities in his kingdome, <hi>Math.</hi>
20.21. <hi>Eccle:</hi> 12.12, 1 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 4.29. By Chriſt's ſitting then at the right hand of God, is underſtood, as <hi>the unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable glory, and dignity,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>imperiall</hi> and
<hi>ſoveraigne Authority, or dominion,</hi> which Chriſt hath as man, next under God, over the whole creation; And unto this interpretation of the phraſe we are guided by the ſcripture it ſelfe: The Apoſtle in his quot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion of that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies my footſtoole;</hi> thus varieth the words. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>he muſt raigne, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi> From which variation we may obſerve, that with <hi>Paul,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt to ſit at the right hand of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>toraigne,</hi> are all one: Thus <hi>Peter</hi> alſo having in his ſermon <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35. cited the very ſame place of of the Pſalmiſt, in <hi>v.</hi> 36. he expounds it by Gods making Jeſus <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The ſame expoſition alſo he giveth of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>He is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; Angels, authorities, and powers, being made ſubject unto him.</hi> To be at the right hand of God, is to have Angels, authorities, &amp; powers made ſubject unto him: The largeſt comment that we have in ſcripture upon the phraſe, is in the place now under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: Here the Apoſtle having affirmed, <hi>v.</hi> 20. that the <hi>working of Gods mighty power,</hi> ſet Chriſt on his owne right hand, &amp;c. In,
<hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. he fully explaineth, what is meant by his ſitting at Gods owne right hand; why! to be <hi>farre above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name, that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. To have all things put under his feet, to be given to be head over all things to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We have Chriſts kingdome, ſoveraigne authority, or dominion ſet forth here unto us, <hi>ab objecto principalitatis,</hi> or
<hi>perfectionis,</hi> from it's chiefe or principall objects. 1. The moſt powerfull. 2. The moſt renowned of it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

<hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that if the termes be not <hi>Synonyma,</hi> but have ſeverall ſignifications, that then the Apoſtle ſpeakes of them, not by way of <hi>aſſertion,</hi> but by way of <hi>conceſſion,</hi> or
<hi>ſuppoſition;</hi> in reference, ſay ſome, unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſay others, unto the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> both which might hold ſuch a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the celeſtiall ſpirits, or elſe with relation unto the fables of the Greeke <hi>Poëts,</hi> their <hi>Divines,</hi> who maintained perhaps, ſuch a difference betwixt their <hi>Imaginary Deities;</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, Suppoſe, though not grant, this diſtinction of <hi>principality, and power, and might, and dominion,</hi> yet Chriſt is advanced far above them all, in dignity, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

            <p>For anſwer, the Scripture indeed mentioneth a twofold put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the feete of Chriſt, <hi>penall,</hi> or <hi>obedientiall.</hi> 1. There is <hi>a penall,</hi> and diſgracefull way of putting under the feet of Chriſt by way of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>contempt,</hi> but when the Scripture ſpeakes of that, there is allwaies expreſſe mention made of enemies. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. But putting under the feet of Chriſt, when it is uſed ſimply by it ſelfe, without any ſuch addition of enemies, ſignifieth that which is <hi>obedientiall,</hi> and denoteth the <hi>generall ſubordination</hi> of all creatures whatſoever unto Chriſt. If any differ herein from me, I ſhall deſire him impartially to conſider that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5,6,7,8. Where the Apoſtle hath a large diſcourſe of this very ſubject. And out of this place I ſhall draw three arguments to prove, that the putting all things in ſubjection under the feet of Chriſt, is ſo comprehenſive, as that it takes in not only enemies, but all the creatures.</p>
            <p>1. v. 5. <hi>He hath put in ſubjection unto him the world to come:</hi> that is, heaven; the inhabitants of which are the glorious Saints, and Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:168371:29"/>2. v. 8. <hi>In that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing, that is not put under him.</hi> The Apoſtle (we ſee) is peremptory, and expreſſe, that no creature whatſoever is excepted, or exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this ſubjection; and therefore it would be ſaucineſſe in any man, to reſtraine it only unto enemies.</p>
            <p>3. The 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Pſalme,</hi> out of which this phraſe is applied unto Chriſt, makes mention of <hi>all ſheepe and oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field, the foules of the aire, and the fiſh of the ſea,</hi> and <hi>whatſoever paſſeth through the path's of the ſea's, Pſal.</hi> 8.7,8. that were put under his feet. Now theſe creatures are not capable of any enmity, or hoſtility againſt Chriſt; and therefore the phraſe doth not here ſignify the <hi>ſpeciall ſubjection</hi> of enemies by way of <hi>victory and triumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We have here the ſecond branch of Chriſts dominion, that
<hi>ſpeciall ſoveraignty,</hi> and <hi>ſupreme authority,</hi> which he hath over his Church, <hi>Gave him to be an head over all unto his Church.</hi> that clauſe, <hi>over all,</hi> as is noted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bayne,</hi> may be underſtood either in regard of Chriſt, or the Church.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>regard of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo it denoteth the perfection of his glory, and authority. <hi>Gave him, who is over all things, to be the head unto the Church:</hi> and ſo here is not only ſignified the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, but farther, the greatneſſe of the gift or benefit herein beſtowed by God upon the Church, in that he hath given her a moſt eminent, glorious, and powerfull head: But of this, the Apoſtle ſpeakes ſo fully in the foregoing words, as that to inſert it here againe ſo ſuddenly would be little leſſe then a <hi>tautology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive therefore that the words are meant <hi>in regard of the Church,</hi> ſo that in them is couched <hi>a compariſon of the greater with the leſſe,</hi> of Chriſts head-ſhip unto the Church, with his domination, which he hath above all other creatures. Chriſt may be ſaid to be an head unto the whole univerſe, <hi>He is the head of all principality,</hi> and power, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. But he is an head unto the Church, in a <hi>more ſingular,</hi> and <hi>eminent manner</hi> then he is unto any other of the creatures, then he is unto the Angels. He was unto the Angels only a <hi>mediator of confirmation or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> unto us alſo <hi>a mediator of redemption;</hi> and therefore now being at the right hand of God, he preſents unto him in our<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168371:29"/>behalfe, the ſatisfaction of his death for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, the merit of his death for the ſupply of all our wants, and in ſuch a manner he doth not intercede for the elect Angels, who are free from both ſinne and indigency: Beſides, there is not ſuch a ſuitableneſſe of nature between him and the Angels, as there is between him, and the Church of the redeemed. <hi>For he tooke not on him the nature of Angels: but he tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zanchy</hi> expounds the words, as of the ſingularity of Chriſts love unto the Church, ſo alſo of the extent, and univerſality of his influence upon her. So that <hi>over all things</hi> with him ſounds as much, <hi>as in all things,</hi> in all <hi>mercies,</hi> and benefits needfull unto the Church his body, <hi>in all duties</hi> belonging unto him, as the head of his Church: He communicates unto her all good things, <hi>grace and glory, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. he is preſent with her in all her ſtreits, and ſupplieth her in all her wants: He diſchargeth for her, and unto her, all the offices of an head: he illightneth, quickneth, governeth, and protecteth her. But this interpretation may be thought to be ſtrained, &amp; therefore I ſhall acquieſce in the former touching the <hi>ſpecialty</hi> of Chriſts headſhip,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bayne.</hi>
               </note> or ſoveraignty over the Church. It is more <hi>intimate, communicative</hi> and <hi>beneficiall,</hi> then that over any other Creatures, though never ſo great, and glorious.</p>
            <p>A ſecond place is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9,10,11. Where we have of Chriſts exaltation 1. an <hi>emphaticall affirmation.</hi> 2. a
<hi>large,</hi> and <hi>lively deſcription.</hi>

            <p>1. An emphaticall affirmation. <hi>God alſo hath highly exalted him:</hi> It is not barely ſaid, that God exalted him, but

            <p>2. We have a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>lively deſcription</hi> of Chriſts exaltation. 1. from the <hi>antecedent.</hi> 2. from the <hi>parts, or branches thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We have the <hi>antecedent</hi> of it, Chriſts humiliation:
<hi>He<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168371:30"/>humbled himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. Not only <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but divers
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Zanchy,</hi> are of the opinion, that, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>quapropter, wherefore,</hi> denoteth a <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi> and not only a bare <hi>antecedent. Doctor Featly</hi> to compoſe the controverſy, diſtinguiſheth of Chriſt conſidered as a
<hi>mediatour,</hi> and as <hi>man. Albeit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as mediatour, he merited for us, yet as man he might alſo merit for himſelfe.</hi> I ſhould rather ſay, that by his humiliation, he merited his exaltation, not for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but <hi>for us,</hi> in our behalfe, and for our behoofe: He merited it, as it was the exaltation of a publique perſon, the head of the Church. The firſt light of this, I confeſſe, I had from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

For <hi>the worthineſſe there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is not conſidered in regard of that, wich Chriſt was worthy to receive for himſelfe, but in regard of that, which he was worthy to receive for us. Now he was worthy for himſelfe after the perſonall unitie, to know all miſteries, and to receive all glory, without regard of any worke that ever be did: But to be worthy to receive it, that we might be partakers of it, could not be (with ſafety of Gods juſtice) but by his obedience, and that to the death of the Croſſe.

Hath the perſons of any men been adored, and worſhipped with that Zeale, and ſincerity, as Jeſus Chriſt hath been by his Saints? What mortall wight, or immortall Angell hath been ſo much upon the tongues, and hearts of men, as he? Whoſe life hath been read, or heard with that aſſent, that admiration, and thoſe affections, as his? No name, you ſee, hath been ſo celebrated, and magnified, as his.

            <p>2.

The greateſt chieftaines in the world have had ſome blot, ſome odious <hi>but</hi> or other, upon their names, that have darkened all their glory. Thus the name of <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> was ſullied with
<hi>pride,</hi> drunkeneſſe, and <hi>Luxury;</hi> the name of

The power of mens names hath ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out-lived their perſons. Thoſe, that in their life time have moſt flouriſhed in military glory, whoſe very names hath awed not only their owne, but bordering kingdomes; yet we ſee their authority hath died with them.

            </p>
            <p>1. From the generall ſubordination of all creatures unto it. 2. From their externall confeſſion of it. 3. From the reference of it unto its end, the <hi>glory of God the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A correlato,</hi> from the ſubordination of all rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto it, expreſſed in a borrowed ſpeech, by the bowing of the knee: <hi>that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.</hi> The words plainly have reference unto <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45.23. which place <hi>Rom.</hi>
14.10,11,12. is brought as a proofe of the laſt, and generall judgment,
<hi>we ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt: for it is written, As I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe to God. So then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelfe to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all rationall creatures, and only rationall creatures, ſhall be judged, and therefore they, and only they, are here meant. However they may here in this world make head, and oppoſition againſt the kingdome of Chriſt Jeſus, yet at laſt,<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168371:31"/>in the day of judgment, they ſhall ſubmit thereunto, if not <hi>voluntarily,</hi> yet <hi>by conſtraint:</hi> and from this bowing and bending, this ſubmiſſion of all intellectuall creatures unto Chriſt, we may alſo argue by way of compariſon <hi>from the greater unto the leſſe,</hi> for the univerſall ſubjection of all other creatures in their kind, unto his authority.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ab abjuncto occupato;</hi> from the confeſſion hereof, which ſhall be not only <hi>internall</hi> in the conſcience, but ſome way or other <hi>externall, that every tongue ſhould confeſſe, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord.</hi> The good Angels and the glorious Saints in Heaven together with the Devils, and damned ghoſts in hell, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily knees, nor fleſhly tongues, as men have, yet they have ſome meanes whereby they can, and ſhall, will they, nill they, teſtify their ſubjection unto the Lordſhip and dominion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. We have this ſupremacy of Chriſts authority explained from
<hi>it's end. To the glory of God the Father.</hi> The Kingdome Authority, and dominion of Chriſt hath relation unto the glory, that is, knowledg, worſhip, and ſervice of the Father, and was confer'd upon him purpoſely for the promoting thereof. <hi>Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him, John.</hi> 13.31.</p>
            <p>The third place, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>For to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> That this is ſpoken of Chriſt as <hi>man,</hi> is evident, becauſe the procurement of this dominion was the end of Chriſts death, reſurrection, or revivall. Two things here are to be conſidered. 1. Who are the dead and living here ſpoken of. 2. How his death and reſurrection conduced unto his Lordſhip over theſe dead and living.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Who are the dead and the living</hi> here ſpoken of.

            <p>The <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>living</hi> here are, as appeares by compariſon of this verſe with the foregoing, <hi>ſuch as live unto the Lord, and ſuch as die unto the Lord.</hi> And if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baxter</hi> will ſay, that all the living <hi>live</hi> unto the Lord, and all the dead
<hi>die</hi> unto the Lord, he will make very bold with Scripture to maintain his prejudice: and ſome perhaps may thinke as hardly of him, as he doth of thoſe worthies above mentioned, that he dare pervert Scripture from it's plaine ſenſe. The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to take off believers from deſpiſing and judging one another, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and the argument which he brings to perſwade hereunto, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. is, that all believers are the Lords ſervants: <hi>They all live and die unto him: for to this end, Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead, and of the living.</hi> And if this be the ſcope of the words as Divers, men of great ability and piety, ſuppoſe, why then the living and the dead ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 9. are not all the living and dead, but only ſuch as are believers, and the Lords ſervants.</p>
            <p>In a ſecond place, we are to enquire how Chriſts
<hi>death,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> conduced unto this his

            <p>To come in the laſt place unto the uſe and application of this fullneſſe of Chriſts Authority: and here I ſhall make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation 1. Of the fulneſſe of his office, and authority over the Church. 2. Of the fulneſſe of his authority in generall over the whole univerſe.</p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>Fulneſſe of his office, and authority over his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then they are here to be reprehended, that wrench out of Chriſts own hand his fulneſſe of office, and intrude upon his mediatory power, which is incommunicable unto either men, or Angels. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, ſit thou at my right hand,</hi> Heb. 1.13.
<hi>unto the Angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come,</hi> chap. 2. v. 5. <hi>There is but one mediatour between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of adminiſtration but the ſame Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.5. <hi>there is no Lord like or maſter-like power in any, but in Chriſt; unto us there is but one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts of men have herein been eſpecially faulty,
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Prelatiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Papiſts,</hi> &amp; hence the <hi>Pope</hi> is termed the
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is an antagoniſt, not ſo much unto the natures, or perſon of Chriſt; as unto his unction, and office: and indeed he hath been injurious unto him in all his offices.</p>
            <p>1. Unto his <hi>Prieſtly office,</hi> as by their maſſing prieſts, and<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168371:33"/>maſſe ſacrifice to propitiate for quick and dead, ſo by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating unto the ſaints here on earth a power of ſatisfying, and meriting, and unto the ſaints and Angels in heaven a power of interceding.</p>
            <p>2. Unto his <hi>Propheticall office,</hi> by aſſuming unto himſelfe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſupply Scripture with unwritten traditions; as alſo by arrogating unto himſelfe <hi>infallibility</hi> in the interpretation of Scripture and deciſion of all controverſies of
<hi>religion ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, he hath moſt ſacrilegiouſly detracted from the fulneſſe of Chriſts <hi>Kingly office,</hi> by uſurping the title and office of a viſible and miniſteriall head or viceroy in the church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt warrant, or commiſſion from him, the head and King of the Church: as alſo by taking upon him a vaſt, and almoſt unlimited power, of making lawes concerning eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters, obliging the conſcience <hi>per ſe,</hi> of themſelves, from his meer will, and authority.</p>
            <p>This fulneſs of Chriſts office hath 2. been prejudiced by
<hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> in their inſtitution of divers <hi>Church officers,</hi> as alſo of divers <hi>ceremonies</hi> of <hi>ordained, and myſticall ſignification: appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate unto the worſhip</hi> and
<hi>ſervice of God,</hi> without any licence from Chriſt himſelfe. Herein they have treſpaſſed againſt <hi>his Kingly and Propheticall office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They have invaded his ſoveraignty, or <hi>Kingly office:</hi> for he is, as the chiefe, ſo the only law-giver in his Church, and hath committed unto her (as <hi>Ames</hi> ſheweth out of <hi>Junius</hi> in his reply to <hi>Biſhop Morton</hi>) no <hi>authority</hi> of appointing new things, but a <hi>miniſtery</hi> to obſerve and doe ſuch things, which Chriſt hath appointed with order and decency unto edification.</p>
            <p>Indeed the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. is much uſed by the
<hi>Patrons</hi> of our ceremonies, to prove that the Apoſtle doth grant a generall licence, and authority to all Churches, to ordain ſuch ceremonies as ours. But that herein the place is abuſed, is evinced by the ſaid <hi>Ames med. Theol. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 36. by two arguments.

<hi>decency, &amp;c.</hi>) He dares not affirme, that this is the immediate ſenſe of the place, but only that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. It cannot be denied, but that <hi>decency</hi> doth imply ſuch<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168371:34"/>
               <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> the omiſſion of which neceſſarily inferre <hi>undecency:</hi> But that the omiſſion of ſuch ceremonies as ours, doth inferre <hi>undecency,</hi> the Doctor and all his partie can never make good. What <hi>undecency</hi> can the Doctor prove to be in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſme without the Croſſe, as alſo in publicke pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and preaching without a ſurplice. But of this ſee further in <hi>Ames,</hi> in the places but now quoted. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> may perhaps looke upon him as an inconſiderable Adverſary. But we ſhall thinke his arguments conſiderable, untill the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, or ſome other of his partie, give a ſatisfactory anſwer unto them. In the meane while, let us examine the proofe, that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> brings for this ſenſe: and it is,
<hi>becauſe cuſtome is the only rule of decency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This propoſition, though very ſtrange, is proofeleſſe: and therefore we might as well reject it, as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> dictates it. But I ſhall adde a confutation of it from theſe following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>1. If <hi>cuſtome</hi> be the only rule of <hi>decency,</hi> then nothing elſe can be a rule thereof, beſides cuſtome; but this is falſe: for the light, and law of nature, is alſo a rule thereof, and that infallible.</p>
            <p>2. Nothing can be undecent, that is agreeable unto the only
<hi>rule</hi> of <hi>decency.</hi> But diverſe things are undecent, which yet can plead cuſtome: and this is ſo evident, as that I will not ſo much undervalue the Doctors judgment, as to endeavour any proofe thereof. It is impoſſible, that the only rule of decency ſhould be undecent. But yet it is very poſſible, that many cuſtomes ſhould be undecent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall conclude, that cuſtome is not the only rule of decency.</p>

            <p>As for the other part of the words, <hi>Let all things be done in order;</hi> Ames <hi>in the place forementioned, ſheweth, that order requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſuch ceremonies as ours; and he giveth this reaſon, becauſe order requireth not the inſtitution of any new thing, but only the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168371:34"/>right placing, and diſpoſing of things which are formerly inſtituted:</hi> and this he makes good from the <hi>notation of the word, from the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of order,</hi> which are given by Philoſophers and Divines, &amp;c. <hi>from the context of the Chapter,</hi> and from <hi>the uſage</hi> of the word elſe where.

<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> may be ſometimes rendred
<hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But becauſe it may ſometimes be rendred
<hi>appointment,</hi> will it therefore follow, that it muſt be ſo rendered in this place.</p>
            <p>We may ſay as well as the Doctor, that the words
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, literally import, according unto
<hi>order,</hi> as <hi>order</hi> is taken ſtrictly for the right placing, or ranking of things, one before, another after: and this we have confeſſed even by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Burges</hi> in his rejoy nder unto Ames, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. a book publiſhed by the ſpeciall command of the late King. Moreover this ſenſe is favoured by the coherence: for, 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. we have a particular inſtance of order, in this acception of the word: <hi>Ye may all propheſy one by one,</hi> &amp;c. and not all, or many ſpeake at once. 2. We have the <hi>oppoſitite of order</hi> taken in this ſenſe,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>confuſion.</hi> Let all things be done in order then is as much, as let all things be done without confuſion. And I hope confuſion may be avoided in the worſhip of God, without ſuch ceremonies as ours.</p>
            <p>But we will for once ſuppoſe, though not grant, that the clear importance of the words, is, <hi>that all be done in the church according to cuſtome, and appointment.</hi> Yet the Doctor hath a hard taske to performe, before he can come nigh his concluſion, that <hi>the words of Paul are a proofe of the more then lawfulneſſe of preſcription of ſuch ceremonies as ours in a Church:</hi> For he muſt prove, that <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> and
<hi>order</hi> here are taken in ſuch a latitude, as that they include, not only the cuſtomes and appointments of the Apoſtolicall Churches, but alſo of all the Churches of God in ſucceeding ages: and the performance of this he will find not to be ſo eaſie, as he may imagine. I am<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168371:35"/>ſenſible, that I have by this diſcourſe provoked a very learned and formidable adverſary; but it is only love of the truth hath engaged me in ſo unequall an encounter, and therefore I hope the Doctor will pardon and excuſe my boldneſſe. If he can by dint of argument prove the truth to be on his ſide, I ſhall not be ſorry, or aſhamed to be overcome by him.</p>
            <p>2. Their inſtitution of <hi>Symbolicall ceremonies,</hi> that teach ſpirituall duties by their <hi>myſticall ſignification,</hi> is a derogation from the fulneſſe of Chriſts <hi>Propheticall office.</hi> This the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that book (which the miniſters of <hi>Lincolne dioceſſe</hi> delivered unto <hi>King James, December</hi> 1. 1605.) maketh good, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is the only teacher of his Church, and appointer of all meanes, whereby we ſhould be taught and admoniſhed of any holy duty, and whatſoever he hath thought good to teach his Church, and the meanes whereby, he hath perfectly ſet downe in the holy Scriptures; ſo that to acknowledg any other meanes of teaching and admoniſhing us of our duty, then ſuch as he hath appointed, is to receive another teacher into the Church beſides him, and to confeſſe ſome imperfection in thoſe meanes he hath ordained to teach us by.</hi> Unto them I ſhall take leave to adde the words of <hi>Ames in his freſh ſuite againſt ceremonies,</hi> p. 210, 211. <hi>Only this, by the way, I would learne how we can acknowledg and receive any meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious teaching with faith, except it appeare to be appointed by an authentique teacher and law-giver. And how our Prelates in appointing meanes of ſpirituall teaching, which Chriſt appointed not, can be accounted (therein) miniſteriall teachers under him, as their, and our only authentique teacher? As alſo, if Chriſt be our Authentique teacher in all good that we learn about religion, who taught our Prelates ſuch good manners, as to put feſcues, of their own making, into his hand, and ſo appoint him after what manner, and by what meanes he ſhall teach us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. From this fulneſſe of Chriſts office, and authority, we may inferre the derivation of all <hi>miniſteriall eccleſiaſticall power</hi> from him. Indeed the Church, and her officers may be

What the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5.20. ſpeaketh of preaching the word, is appliable unto the adminiſtration of all other ordinances: We may ſay, we Baptiſe, adminiſter the Lords Supper, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute diſcipline in the ſtead of Chriſt, <hi>vice Chriſti,</hi> as Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and deputies, <hi>Math.</hi>

But this is not all that the phraſe comprehendeth. That a thing be done in <hi>the name of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ames</hi>) <hi>there is indeed required the authority of Chriſt as the efficient cauſe. But moreover there is as well as that required,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But to ſpeake of this ſomewhat more fully, and diſtinctly.
<hi>To do a thing in the name of Chriſt,</hi> is to do it 1. in a manner ſuitable unto his dignity. 2. According unto his command and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. 3. for his glory. 4. with dependance upon and 5. with invocation of him for ſucceſſe. And thus all Chriſts ordinances muſt be diſpenſed by us, and received by the people, and that becauſe the diſpenſation of them, is by the authority and commiſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. We muſt diſpenſe them in ſuch <hi>a holy, devout, &amp; reverend manner</hi> as is ſuitable unto the dignity of Chriſts Perſon, and office. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker de politeiâ Eccleſiaſtic. lib.</hi> 3.
<hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 21. informeth us, that with ſome, <hi>in the name of Chriſt</hi> ſounds as much as in the <hi>feare</hi> of Chriſt. And indeed if we did but ſeriouſly conſider the fulneſſe of his office, how great <hi>a Prophet</hi> he is, how high a <hi>prieſt,</hi> how glorious a <hi>King;</hi> we could not but tremble, when we ſpeake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from, or unto him, we could not but uſe all poſſible caution,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168371:36"/>and preparation in the adminiſtration of all his ordinances. I appeale unto thoſe that make as ſlender proviſion for the
<hi>Pulpit,</hi> as for a table diſcourſe; and there vent ſuch raw, looſe, indigeſted and uncoherent ſtuffe, as makes their auditours even nauſeate the good word of God; VVhether this be to preach in <hi>the name of Chriſt;</hi> whether they that thus preach, have a due regard unto the honour of Chriſt, whom they repreſent: This command of miniſters to adminiſter ordinances in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is agreeable unto the great worth of their
<hi>inſtitutive cauſe,</hi> is a virtuall and implied command of the people, to be obſervant of the like manner, in the receipt of them. If miniſters are in their preaching to handle the word, as the word of Chriſt, in ſuch a meet manner, ſo <hi>boldly faithfully, ſincerely, preparedly</hi> and <hi>decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as it is fit the word, the Embaſſy of the <hi>high Prieſt, and Apoſtle of our profeſſion, the King of Saints,</hi> and head of the Church ſhould be delivered, why then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he people are to receive it, as the word of Chriſt, with ſuch holy, heavenly, teachable and tractable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are due thereunto, and not at any hand to trifle and dally with it. But it is ſtrange, how unapprehenſive men are of the relation, which the word hath unto Chriſt: for men come with as unprepared, unreverent, unawfull, and undevout thoughts and affections to a a ſermon, as to a play. Here their maine errand was to paſſe away their time, to cenſure the poëts abilities, to judge of his play, it's plot, language, and fancy: And there what is their buſineſſe, but to ſpend the houre, to cenſure the miniſters gifts of prayer, and preaching, his matter, his notions, and expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions, to compare him with others, to ſee how farre he fals ſhort of thoſe, whoſe perſons we have in admiration. Oh! Beloved, as you tender your ſoules, think what you are a doing. You are about an ordinance brought unto you in the name of Chriſt; Think with whom you have to doe; It is with him that hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven and in earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Becauſe power to diſpenſe ordinances is by the authority, and commiſſion of Chriſt, therefore miniſters and people in the adminiſtration of them ſhould doe all <hi>in the name of Chriſt:</hi> that is, they ſhould keepe exactly unto his command and rule, and not deviate therefrom, or adde thereunto. God hath placed<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168371:36"/>Chriſt in ſuch an eminency over the Church, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſet over
<hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, thou ſhalt be over my houſe, and according unto thy word ſhall all my people be ruled: Without thee ſhall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41. <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, 44. Thus Chriſt is over the houſe, the Church of God, which muſt be exactly regulated, according unto his word: nothing muſt be impoſed by the miniſter, or imbraced by the people in Gods worſhip and ſervice, without his warrant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, both miniſters and people in the managery of Chriſts ordinances, are to do all <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> that is, for the glory and honour of Chriſt, for his names ſake, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.29.

            </p>
            <p>If all our actions are to have this reference, then much more our ſacred actions, our acts of worſhip and religion; Men would never make them ſubordinate unto inferiour ends, if they were duely mindfull of that ſupereminent authority, from which they have their inſtitution: there is a ſtrange tradition of <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſeventh, that for the better credit of his eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als abroad with the contrary ſide, he did uſe to have them cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or excommunicated at <hi>Pauls</hi> (by name) amongſt the

               </note> but though Atheiſticall and Machivilian politicians have thus ſerved their turnes upon the ordinances of Chriſt, it would be very ſtrange that the Miniſters of Chriſt, and <hi>ſtewards of the myſteries of God,</hi> ſhould be thus unfaithfull: Who can wee expect ſhould be carefull of promoting Chriſts glory in his ordinances? if they, who by <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commiſſion</hi> be intruſted with their diſpenſation, be neglective thereof, &amp; make their principall ayme in them the furtherance of their <hi>private deſignes,</hi> the ſhewing of their parts, venting of their paſſions, winning of applauſe, filling of their purſes, ingratiating, or ingrandizing themſelves with the great men of the world. All the authority, that we have in ſpirituall, and Eccleſiaſticall<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168371:37"/>matters, is only by
<hi>commiſſion</hi> from Chriſt, and therefore we ſhould be, if not aſhamed, yet afraid to imploy it any otherwiſe then for him; and yet there have been ſome miniſters in all ages that have abuſed their calling unto his diſſervice, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, their chiefe end in the worke of the miniſtery hath been their owne advancement in temporals, and therefore they have made the Goſpell bend unto the vaine and ſinfull humors of men, upon whom their preferment in the world hath depended, they have wreſted and
<hi>perverted the word of Chriſt</hi> unto the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of their

               <hi>the Grecian Biſhops were wrought upon by the flattery and large promiſes of Andronicus, to give him a generall abſolution from the perfidious perjuries, and bloody murders he had committed, which obtained, he had for a while the ſame Biſhops in great honour, but ſhortly after in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt;</hi> as men forgetfull of their duties, and calling.

In ſtating of any controverſy Baſilius firſt ſtudied to find out what Andronicus intended or deſired to do therein: And then let him alone to draw that Scripture, which would not come of it ſelfe, to prove the lawfullneſſe of what the other would practiſe. Thus in favour of him he pronounced the legality of two moſt inceſtuous matches; And this Grecian Pope gave him a diſpenſation to free him from all oathes, &amp;c. which he had formerly ſworne to Manuel or Alexius. King Philip the ſecond of Spaine, had a counſell of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for the direction of his enterpriſes, which often ſtretched their conſciences to bring him out of many difficulties, and free him from the bands of his promiſes, but theſe, and all others of the like ſtampe, have left but an infamous memory behind them; for men generally refuſe to pay any reſpects unto their names, that have been diſregardfull of the <hi>name</hi> and honour of their heavenly <hi>Maſter. Michael Paleologus, to aſſure the Greek Empire unto himſelfe and poſterity, acknowledged, againſt the light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of his conſcience, the ſupremacy of the Pope of Rome, and did his utmoſt to unite, and conforme the Greek Church unto the Latine; but this his politique device, (as is gravely obſerved by the author of<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168371:37"/>the Turkiſh hiſtory) yeelded him not ſo much, as the credit of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble funerall, but dying in this attempt, not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lyſimachia, was there, by his ſonne Andronicus his commandment, for whoſe advancement he had ſtayned, both his faith &amp; honour, obſcurely buried in the feild a good way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p, as unworthy of a better ſepulchre, for betraying that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in his own judgment was moſt agreable unto the will, &amp; mind of his Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Miniſters and people ſhould approach all ordinances
<hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> that is, with dependance upon him for their ſucceſſe and efficacy; thus the forme of ſpeech is uſed concerning
<hi>God, Pſal.</hi> 20.5. <hi>In the name of our God, we will ſet up our banners.</hi> In the name of God, that is, depending upon God for aſſiſtance: and why may it not have the ſame ſenſe applied unto Chriſt? our confidence in prayer, preaching, Baptizing, adminiſtring of the Lords ſupper, exerciſe of diſcipline ſhould be only upon the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and not upon the ordinances in themſelves, or upon the parts, gifts, and graces of any Miniſters whatſoever; for what are the ableſt and holieſt miniſters, but <hi>inſtruments?</hi> and therefore whatſoever they act towards the Salvation of mens ſoules, is in the vertue of Chriſt their <hi>principall agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without the concurrence of his Spirit, the ſacraments will prove but blankes, or empty and naked ſignes, the word, otherwiſe <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> will prove altogether powerleſſe, or elſe
<hi>the power of God</hi> meerly unto <hi>conviction</hi> &amp;
<hi>condemnation;</hi> the delivery of a man unto <hi>Satan</hi> will but irritate, and exaſperate, and contribute nothing unto the ſalvation of the Spirit in the day of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Mahomet the great Turk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hearing that Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg would cut helmets, head pieces, and pouldrons cleane aſunder with his Scymitar, he ſent to him for it, thinking that there had been ſome extraordinary vertue in it, and when Scanderbeg had ſent it, he put it into their hands, who had the ſtrongeſt armes about him, but perceiving no ſuch wonders as was reported of it, he ſent it back with ſcorne, ſaying that he could get as good for his money out of every cutlers ſhop, &amp; that he credited not what was related to him thereof, but Scanderbeg, in the ſight of the Meſſenger, having made ſtrange and admirable proofes of it, bad him tell his maſter, that it was not the vertue of the ſword, but the ſtrength of his arme.</hi> To apply this unto our preſent purpoſe, <hi>the word of Chriſt is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168371:38"/>dividing aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Heb.</hi> 4.12. But now this is not by any vertue <hi>inherent</hi> in it, but by the power and Spirit of Chriſt
<hi>concurring</hi> with it, actuating, applying, and mightily enforcing of it. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. The Goſpell is refer'd to the Prophets and Apoſtles, in regard of <hi>miniſtry</hi> and <hi>diſpenſation, our report;</hi> but it is refer'd to the Lord, only in point <hi>of efficacy</hi> and <hi>operation, the arme of the Lord.</hi> Upon the Lord Chriſt therefore let us depend, and to him let us repaire for the ſucceſſe thereof, which brings me to the laſt particular.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Miniſters and people are, in the ordinances of Chriſt, all acts of worſhip, to do all <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> that is, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of his name, calling upon the name of God through his mediation; and this to be included in the phraſe, as it is uſed
<hi>Col,</hi> 3.17. is the conſent of moſt interpreters on the place, by this it is, that as all creatures, and actions in generall, ſo all ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a more ſpeciall and peculiar manner, are ſanctified unto us.</p>
            <p>How can we, with any probability, expect a bleſſing from Chriſt upon our publique aſſemblies, on the Lords day, when we ruſh unto them from our beds, or worldly buſineſſe, without ſo much as imploring ſuch a bleſſing in our families or cloſets. If we do not ſeeke Chriſt in our home devotions, in a way of preparation unto our publique; I believe we can hardly be ſaid to be <hi>gathered together in his name,</hi> according to the full import of the expreſſion; and without this, it will be but preſumption to flatter our ſelves, that Chriſt will be in the <hi>mid'ſt of us.</hi> Doth a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach in the
<hi>name</hi> of Chriſt, when he doth not before hand ſo much as open his mouth for <hi>Chriſts aſſiſtance</hi> in his ſtudy, and concurrence in his pulpit? Do people heare <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> when all the weeke long they do not put up ſo much as one petition unto him, to enable their miniſter for his worke, and to bleſſe it unto them? And if we do not meet together in the <hi>name of Chriſt,</hi> we may juſtly feare, that Chriſt will be a ſtranger unto our meetings.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This fulneſſe of Chriſts office beſpeakes our due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; it challengeth faith in him, obedience unto him, and worſhip of him. All Saints ſhould obey the King of Saints;<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168371:38"/>the members of the Church ſhould follow the full direction of their head, both
<hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>outward:</hi> ſervants ſhould be ruled by the ſonne, and Lord of the family: ſheep ſhould be guided by their ſhepherd: the ſtones in the <hi>ſpirituall building</hi> ſhould be regulated unto the foundation: Not to hearken unto the <hi>meſſenger</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> how can it be interpreted any other, then a refuſall of the Covenant. To ſlight <hi>the high Prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> what is it, but a vertuall renouncing of the Chriſtian religion. To be diſobedient and diſloyall unto the King, and head of the Church, what is it, but an interpretative diſclaiming of his ſoveraignty over the Church. <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, Heb.</hi> 3.1. The Greeke word,

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as <hi>Pareus</hi> noteth) is very emphaticall: for it ſignifies not barely to underſtand, apprehend, or behold a thing, but farther; with very great and earneſt endeavour to bend and apply the mind unto the conſideration of a thing, to conſider it diligently, and heedfully. Conſider <hi>the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion</hi> is as much, as ponder the perfection of Chriſts office, with all poſſible diligence and attention, with all your heart and minds. But now words of knowledge, in Scripture, imply the affections and practice; <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion, </hi> that is, attentively and deeply weigh the fulneſſe, and dignity of his calling, and accordingly feare, love, worſhip, ſerve and obey him. Give him all honour, and glory, throw all your faith and hope upon him, ſeeke for your ſalvation only in him, and carefully decline all offence of him. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having proved, 1. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>out of the Prophet Iſaiah, that Chriſt is the chiefe corner ſtone, elect, and precious, which God hath laid in Zion,</hi> the ſpirituall houſe of his Church: he inferreth hereupon,

               </gap>; and the putting of <hi>Abſtracts</hi> for their <hi>Concretes</hi> uſually encreaſeth and heightneth a matter, and puts weight and an emphaſis upon it. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that believe, he is an honour:</hi> that is, he is or ſhould be very honourable, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding precious in your eies; and indeed whom ſhould we eſteeme, reverence, and honour, if not the foundation of our ſalvation<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168371:39"/>that by the faithfull, and full diſcharge of his office, upholds every one of our ſoules, from ſinking into the very bottom of hell and damnation. Can we have too high an eſtimate of ſuch a perſon? Who would not come unto him, and by faith leane upon him. Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> exhorts hereunto, and backs his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with many motives,
<hi>He is a ſtone, a chiefe corner ſtone, verſ.</hi> 4, 6. and therefore you may ſafely rely upon him. He <hi>is a living ſtone,</hi> a vitall foundation, and therefore <hi>quickneth whom he will, Joh.</hi> 5.21. He maketh every member a <hi>lively ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore that are not built upon him, are ſpiritually dead and liveleſſe. Indeed not only the Jewes, but the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men reject all his offices, refuſe to build and rely upon him. But though he be
<hi>diſallowed of men, he is choſen of God,</hi> God from all eternity deſigned him unto this <hi>office</hi> of <hi>foundation,</hi> and in the fulneſſe of time actually called, ſent, ſealed, ſanctified, qualified and enabled him, for execution thereof. He is a ſtone as of great ſtrength, ſo of great price alſo: <hi>he is a precious ſtone,</hi> precious in regard of the infinite dignity of his perſon, <hi>precious</hi> in reſpect of the incomparable value of his ſatisfaction, and merit; and
<hi>precious</hi> alſo in regard of the riches of the gifts, and graces, wherewith his humane nature was adorned. Thus you ſee, that here is ſtability, an enlivening efficacy, the decree and call of heaven, unſpeakable beauty and excellency, inviting to come unto Chriſt: come unto him, becauſe he is a ſtone, a living ſtone, a ſtone choſen by God, a precious ſtone. You may ſee farther, how that by coming unto him, great and ineffable benefit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and honour, will redound unto us. It will be a profitable, a comfortable, or honourable Courſe.</p>
            <p>1. Then it will be very <hi>beneficiall</hi> and advantageous unto us; if we come unto him, as unto a <hi>living ſtone,</hi> we ſhall as
<hi>lively ſtones be built up a ſpirituall houſe, v.</hi> 5. for an
<hi>habitation of God through the ſpirit, Epheſ.</hi> 2.21. And without dependance upon him, as our foundation, by faith, there will be no place and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence for us in the ſpirituall ſtructure.</p>
            <p>2. It will be very <hi>comfortable</hi> unto us, <hi>Behold I lay in Zion a chiefe corner ſtone, </hi> and <hi>he that believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded, v.</hi> 6, that is, ſhall not be diſappointed of his hope:<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168371:39"/>all other foundations will faile men, and prove but as a <hi>Spiders web, Job.</hi> 8.14. ſo that whoſoever relieth on them, ſhall be <hi>covered with ſhame, and confuſion of face:</hi> In the words, I believe, there is a <hi>litotes,</hi> by deniall of Confuſion and ſhame, is underſtood the affirmation of extraordinary comfort, and confidence. <hi>He that believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed or confounded:</hi> that is, he ſhall lift up his head with a full joy, triumph, and unſhaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, whereas others ſhall hide their heads, and not be able to looke the lambe in the face, as being utterly abaſhed at the vanity, and deceitfulneſſe of thoſe foundations, upon which they have built, and relied.</p>
            <p>From this in the third place, the Apoſtle inferreth the
<hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of thoſe that by faith leane upon him, as a foundation. <hi>He that believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded; unto you therefore which believe he is an honour, v.</hi> 6, 7. &amp; indeed for a man to have his expectation concerning the eternall happineſſe of his ſoule fully anſwered at the laſt day, when the hopes of the great, and wiſe men of the world ſhall be utterly fruſtrate, muſt needs make much for a mans honour in the ſight of men, and Angels. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you which believe he is an honour,</hi> becauſe you have honoured him, received his teſtimony, ſet your ſeale as it were to his veracity, therefore he will honour you, derive unto you his honour and glory, make you in &amp; together with him the <hi>Sons of God, heires of Heaven, ſpirituall Kings and prieſts, Revel.</hi>
1.6.</p>
            <p>To conclude what I have to ſay at preſent, touching this
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſts <hi>office</hi> over the Church. Submiſſion unto it is a thing, from which we are of our ſelves averſe: The reſolve of the Jewes is the naturall language of every carnall mans heart, <hi>We will not have this man to reigne over us, Luk.</hi> 19.14. Well therefore, let us humbly implore the over-ruling influence of heaven to worke us unto an unfeigned acknowledgment of, and ſincere obedience unto the full authority of Chriſt: for <hi>no man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. It is an eaſy matter <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>verbally</hi> to profeſſe it, but to acknowledge it <hi>cordially</hi> and <hi>affectionately</hi> out of a true faith, and full perſwaſion of heart, impoſſible, unleſſe we be taught, ſwayed, and acted by the Holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:168371:40"/>2. I ſhall proceed to that uſe and application which may be made of the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſts
<hi>authority</hi> in <hi>generall</hi> over the whole <hi>univerſe,</hi> wherein I ſhall not wholly exclude his fulneſſe of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his
<hi>Church,</hi> but ſhall ſometimes have reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>1. Then for information, we may hence inferre the dignity of the members and miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt, they are the ſervants, ſubjects, friends, favourites, brethren, nay ſpouſe of him that hath <hi>all power in heaven, and in earth:</hi> and to be ſo neerely, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately related unto a perſon of ſuch power, and authority, is in <hi>heavens Herauldry</hi> a farre greater honour, then to be abſolute, and univerſall monarch of the whole earth. This is an unſpeakable comfort unto all true believers in their loweſt condition, and ſhould be a ſtrong engagement to walke ſuitably unto the height of ſuch relations, as becommeth the ſervants of ſo great a maſter, the ſubjects, nay friends and favourites of ſo redoubted a king, the ſpouſe of ſo powerfull and glorious a husband.</p>
            <p>2. We may hence inferre the <hi>dignity</hi> of the
<hi>miniſters</hi> of Chriſt. They have their office, and commiſſion from him, that hath a commiſſion from the father to governe all creatures in heaven and in earth: They are the only <hi>Embaſſadours of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> the keepers of his great ſeales, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the <hi>ſtewards,</hi> and <hi>rulers of his houſe,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>And from this dignity of the miniſteriall function, we may preſſe both miniſters and people, unto their ſeverall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective duties.</p>
            <p>1. The Dignity of miniſters ſhould mind them of, and move them unto their duty, not to walke beneath the eminency of that relation, which they have unto their great Lord, and maſter, the prince of all the Kings of the earth. His name is above every name, and therefore they who are <hi>choſen veſſels to beare his name, Act.</hi> 9.15. ſhould be very carefull not to caſt any reproach, or diſhonour upon his name: not to occaſion the blaſphemie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by any either indiſcretion, or ſcandall in their converſation. It would be a very great, and foule incongruence, if whereas Chriſt, who hath a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of all <hi>authority,</hi> hath given them an<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168371:40"/>office worthy of double honour, yet notwithſtanding they ſhould render their perſons vile, and contemptible.</p>
            <p>2. The dignity of miniſters ſhould be a powerfull incentive unto their people to give them all due reſpect, <hi>double honour,</hi> as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.17. I cannot enforce this uſe better, then in the words of one of the beſt of our Engliſh Prelates,
<hi>Biſhop Lake. He that looketh upon the perſons of miniſters only, will not much eſteeme either them, or their words; but adde whoſe miniſters they are, and that requireth reverence to be yeelded to their perſons, and obedience to their doctrine. Eſpecially, if we conſider, that all thoſe to whom they come, are at his mercy from whom they come; for he hath power over them all; and ſuch power he muſt have that ſends: ſo it is not a meſſage ſent by a King to a neighbour King, but by a King to his vaſſals; the more are they to be reſpected, and their words heeded.</hi> States, and Princes in all ages have had a very deep reſentment of injuries done unto their Embaſſadours. How ſeverely did <hi>David</hi> revenge the diſgrace that <hi>Hanun</hi> put upon his meſſengers, 2 <hi>Sam. Chapters</hi> 10, 11, 12. And the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> extinguiſhed
<hi>Corinth,</hi> though <hi>the eye of Greece,</hi> for violating their Embaſſadours, and yet the violation was ſo ſmall, as that
<hi>Florus</hi> could not tell, whether it were <hi>voce,</hi> or
<hi>manu.</hi> What ſeverity then may they expect in the day of retribution, the greateſt part of whoſe religion is to heap indignities upon the meſſengers of Chriſt Jeſus, whom he hath ſent with the offer of peace, and pardon unto the ſonnes of men. For if earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Potentates be ſo tender, and touchy in the point of their Embaſſadours honour and ſafety, can they dreame, that Chriſt, who hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven &amp; earth,</hi> ſhould be ſo tamely inſenſible of the affronts, that are offered unto his Embaſſadours, as without repentance to ſuffer them to paſſe unpuniſhed and unrevenged? Doth not he himſelfe tell us, that a bare contempt of his miniſters, much more all violent and other injurious treatings of them, reflect in the upſhot upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his father?
<hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me, Luk.</hi> 10.16. They have their commiſſion from him, and he hath his from his father: He ſends them, and his father him. <hi>As my father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you, Joh.</hi> 20.21. If then we ſlight, wrong, or violence<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168371:41"/>them, both he and his father may juſtly interpret it, as done unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. Here is an uſe of terrour unto all the enemies of Chriſt, whether <hi>open</hi> and <hi>profeſſed,</hi> or <hi>ſecret</hi> and
<hi>diſſembled.</hi> Can there be a point of greater folly, then for
<hi>impotent duſt and aſhes</hi> to be againſt him, that hath <hi>all power in heaven and earth, all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed unto him,</hi> authority to ſentence all his enemies unto eternall flames, and torments? All oppoſition of him is like the daſhing of an earthen veſſel againſt a great ſtone, or rock: for he is the head of the corner, <hi>and whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone, ſhall be broken: but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder, Math.</hi> 21.44. All his enemies, all unregenerate and unbelieving perſons whatſoever, may be ſaid to fall on him: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them he is a ſtone of ſtumbling &amp; rock of offence,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. And they ſhall all of them be broken either to their
<hi>converſion,</hi> or <hi>deſtruction.</hi> But now as for reprobates, ſuch as die in finall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe and impenitency, Chriſt is an enemy unto them, he falleth on them, as a great ſtone from an high place, and therefore he ſhall grind them to powder: they ſhall utterly, and irrecoverably be deſtroyed. <hi>What King</hi> (ſaith our ſaviour) <hi>going to make war againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt and conſulteth, whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand? or elſe, while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an Embaſſage, and deſireth conditions of peace, Luk.</hi> 14.31,32. Theſe fooliſh ſoules that wage warre againſt Chriſt, <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> if they would conſult their owne ſafety, ſo farre as to conſider how unable ſuch poore wormes as they, are to cope and encounter with him, that hath all the hoſtes of the Lord under his command, They would ſpeedily lay aſide all farther thoughts of hoſtility, and ſend their teares and prayers as Embaſſadours, and deſire conditions of peace upon Chriſts own termes. It was a vaine bragge of

                  <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pompey,</hi> that as oft as he did but ſtampe with his foot upon the ground of
<hi>Italy,</hi> he ſhould bring men enough out of every corner, both footmen and horſemen. But much more may truly be averred of Chriſt, he hath heaven, earth, and hell, at a beck, and can when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſe, arme the whole creation againſt all that oppoſe <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:168371:41"/>But indeed his <hi>juſtice</hi> doth not goe alwaies in the ſame path, or pace. His <hi>patience</hi> many times grants a reprive unto his greateſt enemies, during their lives here on earth. Latter ages have hardly afforded a more bloudy, and cruell adverſary unto the Church of Chriſt, then the <hi>Duke of Alva:</hi> and yet Chriſt ſuffered his
<hi>hoare head to goe downe to the grave in peace.</hi> But there will come a day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, and Chriſt. And then <hi>Chriſt will put all his enemies under his feete: His father will make them all his footſtoole.</hi> Then the ſtouteſt, and proudeſt of his enemies ſhall be ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their
<hi>Impotency,</hi> and when it is too late, repent their mad and ſucceſſeleſſe aſſaults of his kingdome. <hi>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe captaines, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man, ſhall hide themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and ſhall ſay to the mountaines and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſetteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb, Rev:</hi>
16.15,16.</p>
            <p>How will the <hi>boares</hi> out of the wood, that have waſted the vineyard of the Lord, and the <hi>wild beaſts</hi> of the field, that have devoured it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.13. The <hi>Foxes,</hi> the little Foxes, that ſpoile the vines, the tender grapes, how I ſay, will they be filled with deſpaire and confuſion, when they ſhall come to be cenſured for this <hi>by the Lord of the vine-yard?</hi> How will they be able to look in the face <hi>the Lord of the harveſt,</hi> whoſe chiefe deſigne hath been to hinder the <hi>ſending of labourers into the harveſt;</hi> &amp; to obſtruct their worke, and labour there in? how will thoſe <hi>Tobiak's</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallat's, &amp;c.</hi> be confounded, who have uſed all their intereſt and power in the world to oppoſe the building, repairing and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the houſe, the Church of God, when for this they ſhall be called unto an account by the ſonne, that <hi>is Lord of the houſe?</hi> When thoſe that have all their lives long been obſtinate profaners, and impugners of the ſabbath, and all other ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they ſhall ſee their judge, the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath</hi> and all other ordinances, how unſpeakable will their horror, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement be? One great part of the torments of thoſe, that have waged warre againſt the ſaints, will be, that the doome of the everlaſting ſtate of their ſoules is to proceed out of the mouth<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168371:42"/>of the <hi>King of Saints.</hi> No tongue can decypher, no heart imagine the terrours that will overwhelme thoſe
<hi>wolves,</hi> that have worried the <hi>ſheepe</hi> of Chriſt, when they ſhall ſee themſelves drag'd unto the tribunall of <hi>the great ſhepherd of</hi> the ſheepe. At that laſt day the lot of all Chriſts enemies will be fatall, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and Chriſt himſelfe giveth ſo comprehenſive a character of his enemies, as takes in all, that in the Church viſible are not active for his cauſe, and glory; all that concurre not with him in promoting the ſalvation of mens ſoules; all that endeavour not according to their callings to gather in unto his Church. <hi>He that is not with me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is againſt me: and he that gathereth not with me ſcattereth abroad, Math.</hi> 12.30.</p>
            <p>But now the condition of none of Chriſt's enemies will be ſo unſupportable, as that of thoſe, who are <hi>viſibly</hi> ſubjects, and yet <hi>cordially</hi> enemies, who <hi>profeſſe</hi> ſervice and ſubjection, and yet <hi>practiſe</hi> nothing but enmity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sydon, for the land of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> for infidels, Turkes, and Pagans, then for ſuch, becauſe they adde unto their hoſtility, falſehood, treachery, and mockery: They deale with Chriſt, as the ſouldiers that ſaid unto him; <hi>Haile, King of the Jewes: but it was in a</hi> way of ſcorne, for <hi>they crowned him with thornes, &amp; ſmote him with their hands, Joh.</hi> 19.2,3. How bitterly did Chriſt himſelfe expoſtulate with ſuch hypocrites? <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and doe not the things which I ſay? Luk.</hi> 6.46. If men were but duely ſenſible of Chriſts ſoveraigne authority they would tremble at their hypocriſy in profeſſing, that Chriſt is their
<hi>King,</hi> when in the meane while they are wholly ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the worſt of his enemies, the baſeſt of their luſts. As for thoſe citizens of Chriſt, the members of his Church viſible, that hated him, and ſent a meſſage after him, ſaying, <hi>we will not have this man to reigne over us,</hi> how ſolemne and dreadfull is their execution. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould reigne over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me, Luk.</hi> 19.14,27.</p>
            <p>But now Chriſt will handle none of his enemies with more rigour, then thoſe, that take a commiſſion from him. If <hi>the builders reject the head of the corner,</hi> the chiefe corner ſtone, what can they expect, but either to fall on this ſtone, or to have<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168371:42"/>this ſtone fall on them, and ſo to be broken in pieces unto perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ground unto powder, to periſh utterly by the higheſt degrees of puniſhment. What Prince or ſtate but would moſt ſeverely puniſh the perfidiouſneſſe of ſuch Embaſſadours, as being ſent to pacify a rebellion ſhould underhand animate unto it? Oh, what doth more encourage, and harden men in their rebellion againſt Chriſt, then the diſobedience of thoſe, whoſe office it is to take them off from it? <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt Chriſt are unmeete <hi>orators</hi> to perſwade unto loyalty, &amp; ſubmiſſion unto him, becauſe altogether unlikely to prevaile.
<hi>We are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. But the Rhetorick of our Pulpits will never wooe men hereunto, when our lives ſpeake a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory language. It is altogether improbable, that we ſhould <hi>perſwade men to be reconciled unto Chriſt,</hi> when they ſee us our ſelves unreconciled, and in defiance of him; what more treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable almoſt in warre, then for commiſſion-officers to give aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance unto the enemy. Our miniſtery is <hi>a warfare,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.7. and is it not high treaſon then, for miniſters by their doctrine, or example, to give ſuccour unto, or to cooperate with the enemies of Chriſt Jeſus, the ſins and errours of their people.</p>
            <p>For a captaine to exhort his ſouldiers to fight valiantly, and preſently to run over unto the enemy, will adde ſcorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto his treaſon: and we may ſay as much concerning mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters exhortations of their people unto a ſpirituall warfare; if when they come downe from their pulpits, they runne over unto the <hi>tents</hi> of <hi>ſin, Satan,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and march under their colours. I ſhall conclude this uſe with <hi>Math.</hi> 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> 48, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto the end. Where we have the <hi>Character,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of a wicked miniſter. 1. the <hi>Character,</hi> his ſinne againſt Chriſt, his fellow miniſters, and his flock or people. 1. His ſin againſt Chriſt, is, <hi>unbeliefe</hi> of his judiciary power, one branch of his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty: <hi>that evill ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, verſ.</hi> 48. (2) We have his <hi>malignity</hi> againſt ſuch of his fellow miniſters, as are pious, and painfull: <hi>and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow ſervants, verſ.</hi> 49. (3) We have his participation of, and fellowſhip with the ſins of his people: <hi>And to eate, and drinke with the drunken: verſ.</hi> 49. Laſtly, we have Chriſts puniſhment<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168371:43"/>of him for this: <hi>The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an houre, that he is not ware of: and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, v.</hi> 50, 51.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>They are aſſured of communion with Chriſt in it,</hi> by way of <hi>analogy and reſemblance.</hi> To ſit at the right hand of God is Chriſts incommunicable priviledge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, ſit on my right hand, &amp;c.</hi> But yet the Church ſits at Chriſts right hand. <hi>

The words are to be underſtood of the faithfull, ſitting with Chriſt in judgment over the nations at the laſt day, as <hi>aſeſſors,</hi> aſſenting unto, and approving of his ſentence againſt them. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto his diſciples, verily, I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael, Math.</hi> 19.28,

            <p>1. Againſt the <hi>guilt of ſinne.</hi> The father would never have thus highly advanced him, given him ſuch a vaſt and boundleſſe dominion, if he had not fully ſatisfied his juſtice, and cleared the debts of all his members. We reade in the relation of the proceedings againſt S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> at the Kings bench barre at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
1618. <hi>October</hi> 28, that when he was demanded, why execution ſhould not be done upon him, according to the judgment pronounced <hi>at Wincheſter</hi> againſt him: <hi>His anſwer</hi> was, <hi>that he was told by his counſell, that in regard his majeſty ſince the ſaid judgment had been pleaſed to employ him in his ſervice, as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he had done, it made void the ſaid judgment, and was a veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication unto him,</hi> and gave him as it were, <hi>a new life, and vigor.</hi> This plea, though juſt and agreeable unto reaſon, and unto law too, as I have been informed by thoſe, that are very well skild in the lawes of the land, yet could not ſave the life of this worthy Gentleman with his partiall, and prejudiced Judges. Yet this we are ſure of, the commiſſion which God hath given unto Chriſt over all creatures in heaven and earth, may ſecure all true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the curſe, and condemnation of the law: for it was <hi>a reall</hi> acquittance and full diſcharge <hi>unto him,</hi> their ſurety, and ſo a <hi>virtuall</hi> pardon <hi>of them: Hence the anſwer, or</hi> apology of a good conſcience unto the cry of ſinne, the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law, and the concurrence of this anſwer unto our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is made by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to depend upon the
<hi>reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, his going into heaven, and his being there on the right hand of God, and the ſubjection of Angels, authorities, and powers unto him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21,22. Hence is it alſo that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the non-condemnation of the elect rather from Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, then his death; becauſe his exaltation is a cleere and full evidence, that his death is abundantly ſatisfactory unto the juſtice of God. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168371:44"/>who alſo maketh interceſſion for us, Rom.</hi> 8.34. many, ſin, Satan and the law, may be ready, and very forward to accuſe, but none of theſe have any power to condemne: <hi>for it is Chriſt that died for us.</hi> And in the death of ſuch a perſon, as Chriſt, there cannot but be a fulneſſe of ſatisfaction. But of this, without his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, we could have had but little aſſurance; and therefore that, with the following parts of his exaltation, the Apoſtle makes the chiefe ground of his confidence: <hi>yea rather that is riſen againe.</hi> He haith paid the utmoſt farthing; for he is delivered out of priſon. He
<hi>is riſen,</hi> nay, he is exalted unto a throne, a crowne, a Kingdome:
<hi>He hath all power given unto him, in heaven, and earth: He is ſate downe at the right hand of God;</hi> and there he hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make interceſſion in the behalfe of all the elect for whatſoever he pleaſeth. If he were not diſburd'ned of the guilt of our ſinne, God would never have thus highly exalted him, never ſuffered him to have been thus neare him, to have had ſuch power, and prevalency with him. Becauſe <hi>the father hath committed all judgment unto the ſonne, Joh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>the ſonne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concludeth</hi> the freedome of all believers from condemnation. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that Heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation: but is paſſed from death unto life, Joh.</hi>
5.24.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, how the fulneſſe of Chriſts ſoveraignty, &amp; domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exempts believers from the <hi>guilt of ſinne.</hi> Now, It is only <hi>guilt</hi> that makes men afraid of death, &amp; hell: it is the ſting of death, it is that, which puts us into danger of hell fire, &amp; therefore being freed from <hi>guilt,</hi> we may be confident to be delivered from the <hi>wrath to come:</hi> we need not fear the arreſt of death, or impriſonment in hell. Chriſt, our mediatour, hath the <hi>keyes of death,</hi> and therefore unto <hi>his,</hi> death ſhall not be a priſon, but a bed, or a withdrawing roome, a place of repoſe: He hath the <hi>keyes of hell,</hi> and therefore he will ſuffer none of theſe to be caſt into it, for whom he hath prepared a manſion in his fathers houſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſts
<hi>authority</hi> may comfort all his members againſt the <hi>power, rage,</hi> and <hi>raigne</hi> of <hi>ſinne,</hi> what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint more uſuall with believers, then that of the violence of their luſts? Oh, ſay they, our corruptions are ſo powerfull and vigorous, as that we are afraid they will ſometime<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168371:44"/>or other break out unto our either diſgrace, if not undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: why! if they would but looke off from themſelves upon Chriſt Jeſus at the right hand of his Father, they might behold him inveſted with authority to mortify their moſt violent luſts, to ſubdue their moſt head-ſtrong corruptions. He gave his Apoſtles power againſt uncleane ſpirits to caſt them out, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.1. <hi>and to heale all manner of ſickneſſe, and all manner of diſeaſes. He gave the ſeventy diſciples power to tread on Serpents and Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and over all the power of the enemy, Luk.</hi> 10.19. So he gives unto his diſciples and members, power to caſt out uncleane habits, &amp; every ſerpentine luſt, which are the ſpawne and broode of that great Serpent. Indeed no wind ſo boiſterous &amp; impetuous as the unmortified paſſions of men, no ſea ſo tempeſtuous, ſo rough or reſtleſſe, as the hearts of unregenerate men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up wire and dirt.</hi> The ſea is calme ſometimes, but there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall tempeſt in their boſomes, their luſts are alwaies raging, they are like a troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, they caſt up nothing but mire and dirt: All their words and actions are not only ſinfull, but ſins, mire and dirt. But now
<hi>Chriſt is ſuch</hi> a manner of man, as that he can eaſily rebuke
<hi>both, the very wind &amp; ſeas obey him, Mark.</hi> 4.41. He hath ſuch authority from his father, as that he can in all the elect with a word as it were, ſtill the wind of paſſion, and calme the ſea of ſinne, and ſtay it's proud waves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſts power and
<hi>authority</hi> yeelds comfort againſt the <hi>ſtrength, malice, and temptations of Satan.</hi> Chriſt hath the <hi>keyes of hell,</hi> and therefore they that have intereſt in Chriſt, have no reaſon ſlaviſhly to feare all the <hi>Divels in hell:</hi> Satan indeed is the <hi>prince of the power of the aire,</hi> but what is the power of the aire in compariſon of the power of our mediatour, <hi>All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heaven and earth?</hi> Satan
<hi>is compared to a ſtrong man armed, Luk.</hi> 11.21. <hi>but in the next verſe we find, that Chriſt is ſtronger then he, able to overcome, and bind him, to take from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and to divide his ſpoiles, Math.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21,22. The <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>woman</hi> is able to overpower the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the
<hi>ſerpent,</hi> the utmoſt miſchiefe that the <hi>ſeed of the ſerpent,</hi> the Divell, and his inſtruments can doe, is, but to bruiſe the <hi>heele,</hi> and that is<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168371:45"/>no mortall wound, for it is farre from either head or heart: but the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall bruiſe the <hi>head</hi> of the ſerpent, that is,
<hi>deſtroy</hi> the power, the Kingdome, and <hi>workes of the Divell,</hi>
1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.8. <hi>It is true, we wreſtle not againſt fleſh &amp; blood, but againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world &amp;c. Eph.</hi> 6.12. But let us <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord Jeſus, and in the power of his might, for it is a power farre above all principality &amp; power &amp; might and dominion, &amp;c. Eph.</hi> 1.21. Chriſt is the head of all <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality and power, Col.</hi> 2.10. And therefore Paul had good reaſon to be perſwaded,
<hi>that neither Angels, principalities, nor powers ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of Chriſts
<hi>authority</hi> is a ſupport, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto all that belong unto him againſt <hi>oppoſition of men,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>violent</hi> by perſecution, or <hi>fraudulent</hi> by hereſy, &amp; ſchiſme. Why ſhould any member of the Church be diffident, and diſtruſtfull of it's owne, or the Churches ſafety? ſeeing the head of the Church, who hath
<hi>the key of David, openeth, and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth, and no man openeth,</hi> that is, governeth and protecteth his Church irreſiſtably: if we take the word <hi>(irreſiſtably)</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto a final, complete, and victorious reſiſtancy, why ſhould we feare the malice and enmity of weak men, as long as we have the love and favour of ſo potent a Saviour? if he be our friend, no matter though we have all the world for foe, <hi>If he be with and for us, who can be againſt us,</hi> Rom. 8.31. In that terrible invaſion of Iſrael by
<hi>Shalmanaſer,</hi> which ended in the utter ruine, deſolation, and captivity of the whole nation, deſcribed <hi>Iſay.</hi> 8. ult. to <hi>be a time of trouble and darkneſſe, and dimneſſe of anguiſh,</hi> far ſurmounting their former troubles, though very great and grievous

And this government is managed, as by unconceivable wiſdome, <hi>He is the wonderfull Counſellor,</hi> ſo by unſpeakable love, <hi>the Zeale of the Lord of Hoſtes will performe this.</hi> And the ground of this aſſertion is his relation unto us, <hi>He is our everlaſting Father, v,</hi> 6. If the Church be full of diſorder and Confuſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. if the <hi>Spirits of the prophets be not ſubject to the prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. if the whole body affect to be the eye, and the hearing, why! his government is upon <hi>the throne of David and his king dome to order it;</hi> if the Church be in a weake and tottering condition, his <hi>government is upon the throne of David, and upon his Kingdome to eſtabliſh it,</hi> verſ. 7. We find <hi>Pſal:</hi> 80. that when the hedges of the Church of Iſrael were broken downe, the hedge of diſcipline, the hedges of God and the Magiſtrates protection,

And this will ſatisfy and compoſe our ſpirits, let the world goe how it will, let all things be turned topſy turvy, ſo as we goe not back from thee O Lord of Hoſtes, ſo long as there is not in us <hi>an evill heart of unbeliefe,</hi> we hope we ſhall <hi>poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience.</hi> Though the vineyard of the Lord be burnt with fire, and cut downe, though there be ſcarce left among us ſo much as the face of a Church viſible, men may throw us out of our earthly enjoyments, they may ſhut us up in a deep and darke dungeon, and there exclude the light of the Sunne from us, but in ſuch a condition the power of our Mediatour ſhould uphold our ſpirits; He hath the <hi>Key of <pb n="90" facs="tcp:168371:46"/>David; and openeth and no man ſhutteth,</hi> if he open heaven gates unto us, not all the men in earth, not all the Devils in hell, are able to ſhut, or barre them againſt us.

<hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>adherents,</hi> but they are encountered by
<hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> who give them a totall rout and overthrow,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>They prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.</hi> They had no more power to tyrannize over the Church. And it is obſervable, that the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of this great victory are none but poore <hi>martyrs;</hi> for ſuch as theſe were the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Michael,</hi> that is Chriſt, deſcribed to be, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.
<hi>They loved not their lives unto death.</hi> The ſtrongeſt weapons of their warfare are their ſufferings. <hi>The victory that overcometh the world is the faith and patience of the Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.4. The ſhedding of their blood drawes blood from their adverſary, and their
<hi>death</hi> puts <hi>life</hi> into the cauſe which they dye for; ſo that we may ſay of them as of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> at the Battell of
<hi>Lutzen,</hi> they conquer when they are killed. If that befall our Church which <hi>Paul</hi> foretold of the <hi>Church of Epheſus, that grievous wolves enter in among them, not ſparing the flock, Act.</hi> 20.29. <hi>If foxes ſpoyle the vines and tender grapes, Cant.</hi> 2.15. If hereticks, falſe teachers, ſeduce weake Chriſtians, eſpecially new converts, why he is the <hi>great ſhepherd of the ſheepe,</hi> and is able to repreſſe them and chaſe them away: If never ſo malitious &amp; pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t adverſaries aſſayle <hi>the houſe,</hi> the Church of God, why Chriſt is the Lord of the houſe, <hi>and he is faithfull to him, that appointed him, Heb.</hi> 3.2. &amp; therefore there is no need of any other garriſon for it's protection, then his power, and care, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2.1,2,3,4,9.
<hi>the Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, &amp; the rulers take counſell together, againſt the Lord, &amp; againſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, ſaying. Let us breake their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us. He that ſitteth in the heavens ſhall laugh: the Lord<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168371:46"/>ſhall have them in deriſion. Thou ſhalt breake them with a rod of Iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſell.</hi> If ten Kings that have one mind, and have <hi>given their ſtrength and power unto the Beaſt, make warre with the Lamb,</hi> the Lamb ſhall overcome them, <hi>for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, Rev.</hi> 17.13,14. To conclude this firſt branch of this uſe of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having ſpoken largely of the Soveraignty confer'd upon Chriſt in his exaltation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5,6,7,8. in the end of the eight verſe he moveth a doubt againſt it, but <hi>now we ſee not yet all things put under him;</hi> we ſee it indeed with an <hi>eye of faith,</hi> but not with an
<hi>eye of ſenſe,</hi> and carnall reaſon; we may ſay of that as the Apoſtle doth of the future ſtate of the Saints of God, <hi>it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be, but we know, that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is, Joh.</hi> 3.2. but though it doth not yet appeare, yet we believe it, and faith is <hi>an evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11.1. And the Apoſtle in his anſwer unto the doubt layeth downe a very good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſtrengthening of our faith herein. <hi>But we ſee Jeſus who was made a little lower then the Angels for the ſuffering of death crowned with honour and glory, verſ.</hi>
9. ſeeing he is crowned with glory, and placed at the right hand of God, and then hath <hi>all power given unto him, in heaven, and earth,</hi> he will exerciſe this his power, and authority, for the good of his Church and overthrow of his enemyes, and at the laſt day he will put all, either perſons or things, that oppoſe him, abſolutely under his feete, he will ſubdue them and trample upon them as upon a footſtoole.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12,13. <hi>He ſate downe on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtoole.</hi> If he our Soveraigne waits patiently till this worke be done, it would be very bad manners in us his ſubjects to be impatient, and not contented to wait the Lords Leiſure.</p>
            <p>I proceede unto a ſecond benefit accrewing unto believers by the fulneſſe of Chriſts authority, and that is <hi>poſitive,</hi> ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of all things to their ſalvation, ſeeing he hath all power in heaven and in earth, therefore he can make all creatures in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168371:47"/>heaven and earth to promote the glory and happineſſe of his people. Are not the <hi>Angels all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for them, who ſhall be heires of ſalvation? All believers are joint heires with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.17, <hi>Now he is the heire of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.3. therefore they ſhare with him in this his inheritance, and are, in a way of <hi>ſubordination to him,</hi> heires of all things too,
<hi>All things are yours</hi>

Becauſe he is the head of the corner, the Pſalmiſt, &amp; our Saviour himſelfe, would have us to acknowledge <hi>the Lords doing, and that it ſhould be marveilous in our eyes,</hi> Pſ. 118.22. Math. 21.42. The Apoſtle Paul entertains it with ſtupor, and admiration, <hi>what is man! ſayth he,</hi> (that is, the man Chriſt Jesus) <hi>that thou art mindfull of him, or the Son of man, that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteſt him: that thou crowneſt him with glory and honour, and didſt ſet him over the workes of thine hands, that thou put'ſt all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet,</hi> Heb. 2.6,7,8.

<hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee may hence be exhorted unto diverſe dutyes, regarding <hi>Chriſt, faith in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feare and confeſſion of him, obedience, prayer, and conformity unto him:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>faith in him,</hi> our Saviour having mentioned the doctrine of his Soveraignty, all <hi>things are delivered unto me of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Math.</hi> 11.27. He draweth from it <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Come unto me all yee that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt:</hi> that is, believe in mee, and I will give you the reſt of ſatisfaction and conſolation. <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> having <hi>Ioh.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:168371:48"/>3.35. ſpoken of the extent and <hi>univerſality</hi> of Chriſts dominion, he preſently ſubjoyneth verſe 36 the <hi>reward of faith, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment of unbeliefe:</hi> firſt the reward of faith; <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life:</hi> that is, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> expounds it,
<hi>habet eam velut in ſemine,</hi> he hath eternall life
<hi>ſeminally,</hi> he hath the root and cauſe of it, a promiſe of it, an intereſt in the purchaſe of it, a poſſeſſion of the beginning and firſt fruits of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee have the <hi>puniſhment of unbeliefe,</hi> and that, as the but now mentioned <hi>Cajetan</hi> analyſeth the words, is twofold, <hi>poena damni &amp; poena ſenſûs,</hi> the puniſhment of loſſe, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſe: firſt the puniſhment of loſſe, <hi>hee that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life:</hi> that is, ſhall not enjoy life. Secondly, the puniſhment of ſenſe or Torment, <hi>The wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> where againe, as the ſame author obſerveth, we have the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and dominion of the puniſhment of unbelievers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the perſeverance, or permanency of their puniſhment,
<hi>the wrath of God abideth,</hi> Iſa. 54.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the dominion of their puniſhment, <hi>the wrath of God abideth on them; dominium poenae ſignificatur ex praepoſitione ſuper,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> It ſhall not be in the power of the damned to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their thoughts ſo much as one moment from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their torments. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus having told the Jewes that the father had committed all judgement unto him,</hi> Iohn 5.22. he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deduceth herefrom the ſafe and happy condition of all ſuch as believe in him <hi>verſ.</hi> 24 <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation: but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly from this fulneſſe of Chriſts authority wee may be exhorted unto a <hi>feare of him; If Chriſt be our Maſter where is his feare, Mal.</hi> 1.6. whom ſhould we feare, if not him that hath <hi>all power given to him in heaven and in earth,</hi> that <hi>hath all judgment committed to him, who is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell</hi> Math. 12.28. And this uſe the Apoſtle Paul makes of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Phil.
2.9,10,11,12. God <hi>hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name,</hi> that <hi>at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, &amp;c. and that every tongue ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord &amp;c. wherefore, my beloved &amp;c. worke<pb n="95" facs="tcp:168371:48"/>out your owne ſalvation with feare &amp; trembling,</hi> with a feare of
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> towards God, the author of ſalvation; with a feare <hi>of care, caution, prevention, and eſchewall</hi> towards hell, and damnation, the oppoſite of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from hence we may be exhorted unto a bold and undaunted
<hi>profeſſion of him,</hi> why ſhould we be afraid, or aſhamed to confeſſe him, who hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven and earth.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> deriveth the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience</hi> from Chriſts <hi>exaltation,</hi> his <hi>reſurrection, aſcenſion into heaven, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand of God,</hi> and
<hi>the ſubjection of Angells, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes and powers to him,</hi> 1 Pet.
3.21,22. And ſome think, that this <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience</hi> is the <hi>anſwer of confeſſion,</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeakes before, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Sanctify the lord God in your hearts, and be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that aſketh you a reaſon of the hope &amp;c. having a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, we may hence be exhorted unto <hi>obedience to him,</hi> for he is a Lawgiver <hi>able to ſave and deſtroy,</hi> and hath in a readineſſe to <hi>revenge all diſobedience,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.
<hi>Joſephs</hi> exaltation was, thinke many, a type of Chriſts,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 41. <hi>v.</hi> 41, 42, 43. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſet
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> over his houſe or Court, <hi>and over all the land of Aegypt.</hi> God hath ſet Chriſt over his houſe, the church, in a
<hi>ſpeciall way;</hi> over all the world, in a <hi>generall way.</hi> The
<hi>putting of Pharaohs ſignet upon Ioſephs hand,</hi> the <hi>araying of him with veſtures of fine linnen,</hi> the <hi>putting a gold chaine about his neck,</hi> were but dark and weak fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of that ſurpaſſing glory &amp; honour wherewith in his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his humanity was crowned. <hi>Pharaoh made Ioſeph to ride in the ſecond charet.</hi> Chriſts humanity is next and ſecond in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto the Deity. There <hi>were certain officers that cryed before Joſeph bow the knee:</hi> And it is the duty of all miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to cry before Chriſt unto their people to bow and bend the knees of their heart unto him; but if they ſhould be ſilent and remiſſe in their duties, the greatneſſe of his authority invites and beſpeakes ſuch a ſubmiſſion; for he hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven and in earth:</hi> how obedient were thoſe ſouldiers, which were under the Centurion in the Goſpell, I <hi>am, ſaith he, a man under authority, having ſouldiers under me: and I ſay to this man, goe, and he goeth: and to another, come, and he cometh: and<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168371:49"/>to my ſervant, do this, and he doth it, Math.</hi> 8.9. Chriſt, even as man, is under the authority of no creature, but hath a <hi>generall juriſdiction</hi> over all creatures in heaven and earth, but if he ſay to this man, go, he ſtandeth ſtock ſtill, if he ſaith to another come, he never moves out of his place, he ſayth to us his ſervants doe this, and we obſtinatly omit it; The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſſerts the dependency of <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience, upon Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, aſcenſion, and ſoveraignty,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21,22. and by this <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience</hi> ſome underſtand the <hi>readineſſe of a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſanctified conſcience,</hi> to conforme unto the commands of God; and indeed is it not fitting for every good conſcience to be ſubject unto him, unto whome Angells, authorities and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers are made ſubject, to ſay unto him as <hi>Samuel</hi> was directed by <hi>Ely, Speake Lord for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.9. or as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> expreſſeth himſelfe, Pſ. 27.8. <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek ye my face, my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I ſeek, Pſ.</hi> 40.7,8. <hi>Then ſaid I, to I come, &amp;c. I delight to doe thy will, &amp;c, yea thy law is within my heart.</hi> Becauſe all things were delivered to Chriſt of his Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.27. therefore hereupon Chriſt himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth as unto <hi>faith</hi> in him, <hi>come unto me, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 28. ſo alſo unto <hi>obedience</hi> to him, <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and yee ſhall find reſt to your ſoules, verſ.</hi> 29. however your bodies and eſtates may be lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto trouble, the Father hath committed <hi>all judgment to the Son: that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, which hath ſent him, Iohn.</hi> 5.22,23. Indeed the divine excellency, the infinite perfection of the Deity, is the alone <hi>formall object, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ground, reaſon,</hi> or <hi>inducement of divine worſhip;</hi> but yet the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary power delegated unto Chriſt, as mediator, and man, may be a
<hi>great and powerfull motive</hi> hereunto: For by our obedience unto him, we ſhall conſult for our owne indemnity: for his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if we do not bow unto it, will break us; if we do not yeeld him an <hi>active</hi> obedience, he can extort from us a <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience; if we doe not <hi>doe</hi> his will, we ſhall <hi>ſuffer</hi> his wrath; if we doe not
<hi>proſtrate</hi> our ſelves at his feet, <hi>in a way of reverence,</hi> ſervice, and worſhip, we ſhall be <hi>put</hi> under his feet, in a way of <hi>conqueſt,</hi> and triumph, as a footſtoole to be trampled upon: as he hath power to condemne for diſobedience at the laſt day, ſo he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168371:49"/>to chaſtiſe it here in this life with removall of his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>He walketh in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks, Rev.</hi> 1.12,13. And therefore he hath power to remove them where he pleaſe, <hi>he hath in his right hand the Starrs, verſe</hi> 16. the miniſters of his Church, and therefore he can ſuffer an
<hi>Eclipſe</hi> of them, he can rightfully permit the <hi>removall of our teachers into a corner, Iſ.</hi> 30.20. and <hi>the going downe of the Sun upon our Prophets, Mic.</hi> 3.6. He is the <hi>Angell of the Covenant,</hi> and therefore he can upon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, contempt, and refuſall of it, withdraw his ambaſſadors from any place whatſoever: He <hi>is the Lord of the vineyard,</hi> and therefore upon its unfruitfulneſſe, he can expoſe it unto deſolation by the boar out of the wood, and unto devouring by the wild beaſts of the feild, he can ſuffer it to be burnt with fire, to be cut down, he can make it <hi>to periſh at the rebuke of his countenance, Pſ.</hi> 80.13,16. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe Chriſt hath all mediatory power given unto him in heaven and in earth, this may encourage all his, to make their addreſſes <hi>in prayer</hi> unto God, <hi>by him, in his Name,</hi> through his mediation, for may they not with boldneſſe and confidence approach the <hi>holy of holyes,</hi> as long as their acceſſe is by him, who alone hath power of interceſſion with him. It is his office to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and preſent all the prayers of all the Saints <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. and therefore every Saint may be confident of a gracious returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their boſomes of all their prayers, brought unto him. When the people cryed unto Pharaoh for bread, <hi>Pharaoh ſayd unto all the Aegyptians, goe unto Ioſeph, and what he ſayth unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe, and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph opened all the ſtore-houſes, Gen.</hi> 41.55,56.

            <p>There is one uſe or inference more behind, which I muſt not paſſe by, becauſe our Saviour himſelfe makes it; <hi>All power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me in heaven and in earth, goe ye therefore, and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you, Math</hi> 28.18,19,20. The words were ſpoken unto the Apoſtles, but the ſubſtance of the charge belongs unto all miniſters, and that unto the end of the world, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy</hi> taxeth the Prieſts of his time, that they were <hi>partiall in the Law,</hi> chap. 2. ver. 9. we may allude unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſay of many miniſters in our dayes, that they are partiall towards the ordinances of Chriſt. Some will preach, but at no hands meddle with the Sacraments. Others will preach, and baptize, but then they wholly lay aſide the Lords Supper, as if the adminiſtration of it were become a thing ſcandalous in a miniſter. Another ſort are diligent in preaching, and forward in diſpenſation of the Sacraments, but then they have no care at all of diſcipline. Why! are not all theſe, <hi>preaching, Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>diſcipline,</hi> the ordinances of him, that hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven and earth?</hi> How dare theſe men ſo farr tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe their commiſſion from him, as to neglect any one of them? The command of miniſters, to adminiſter all ordinances, is a <hi>vertuall, and implied</hi> command of the people to embrace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all ordinances. If it be our duty to teach them to <hi>obſerve all things, whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded, verſ.</hi> 20. They are not then left at liberty, to obſerve what they pleaſe. Chriſt's power ſhould awe them, as well as us, unto univerſality in their obedience. For if they refuſe but one ordinance, they <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively</hi> deny his Soveraignty: whereas a full, and univerſall<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168371:54"/>conformity unto all his ordinances, exalts him; now he ſits upon his throne, crowned with glory and honour.
<hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Behold King Solomon with the crowne, wherewith his Mother crowned him, in the day of his eſpouſalls, and in the day of the gladneſſe of his heart.</hi> Believers in whom <hi>Chriſt is formed, Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>who do the will of his father, Mat.</hi> 12.50. are the mother of Chriſt; and ſubmiſſion unto his ſcepter, and goverment, is all the crowne they can ſet upon the head of him, whom God hath already made their King. And from this ſubmiſſion, no power or greatneſſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is a priviledge or exemption: for what a <hi>bubble</hi> is any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, in compariſon of all power in heaven and earth? what poor
<hi>wormes</hi> are the greateſt Monarchs, in reſpect of the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> and therefore the Pſalmiſt exhorts the Kings, and Iudges of the earth <hi>to kiſſe the Son:</hi> that is, to doe homage unto him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.10,12. <hi>Canutus,</hi> a King of this land, with his own hands ſet his crowne upon the head of the image of a
<hi>Crucifix</hi> in <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> His ſuperſtition herein was
<hi>abominable,</hi> but the intent of his action, which I Iudge in charity was to expreſſe his acknowledgment of Chriſts ſoveraignty, was <hi>very laudable.</hi> What honourable mention doth Eccleſiaſticall ſtory make of ſuch Princes, as have ſubmitted unto the diſcipline, as well as doctrine of Chriſt? and how famous have they been in all ſucceeding ages? witneſſe what is ſaid of <hi>Philippus,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, for his being content to ſtand amongſt the number of the penitents, who made confeſſion of their ſins: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the praiſes of
<hi>Theodoſius,</hi> for that he confeſſed his fault, againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in ſight of the people with teares. How is <hi>Iohn Ducas</hi> the Greeke Emperour commended for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient acquieſcence in, and penitent ſubmiſſion unto, the bold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of
<hi>Blemmydes,</hi> who ſhut the Church doores againſt his beloved Concubine <hi>Marceſina,</hi> though ſhe was in all her glory, attended with moſt gallants of the Court? The publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, which the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>France,</hi> made of his fault, in vitiating the daughter of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Rochell,</hi> would have rendred him as renowned, as any of thoſe, if his other Apoſtacy, like <hi>a dead fly in the oyntment of the Apothecary, Eccles.</hi> 10.1. had not ſent forth a ſtinking ſavour, and eclipſed the glory of all his former actions. Thus, you have<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168371:55"/>ſeen how the ſupreame, and lordly power of Chriſt over all things, ſhould ſtirr up miniſters unto a diſcharge of their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>It may in the laſt place ſerve further, as a motive to obſerve a due manner in the performance thereof, to doe it with
<hi>diligence,</hi> and with <hi>confidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. With <hi>diligence:</hi> for how can they but expect to be curſed, that doe the worke of ſo powerfull a Lord <hi>negligently?</hi> what can they looke for, but condemnation, that are lazy, and ſlothfull in the ſervice of him, that hath <hi>all Iudgment committed unto him,</hi> and hath authority to throw them into hell, as well for idleneſſe in their callings, as profaneſſe in their lives. The Lord of the harveſt will puniſh all loyterers, and reward none, but ſuch as have been diligent, and faithfull labourers in the harveſt. When the <hi>Lord of the vineyard</hi> ſhall in the even of the world, the day of judgment, take an account of thoſe, that he hath ſent to labour in his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, what will become of thoſe, that have been unmindfull of their errand, and <hi>have ſtood all their lives long idle,</hi> wholy negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the dreſſing, pruning, and fencing of the Lords vineyard? what anſwer can thoſe paſtors make unto the great, &amp; <hi>chiefe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> that have taken no care at all to ſecure their flocks from wolves, and foxes, <hi>Heretiques,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi> Miniſters are but as the uſhers of Chriſt, that one maſter, the principall teacher of his Church: and will he (thinke you) take it well of them, that are not induſtrious in the inſtruction of his diſciples. The doome of the <hi>ſlothfull,</hi> and <hi>unprofitable ſervant, that laid up his talent in a napkin, or hid it in the earth, was to be throwne into utter darkneſſe, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Mat.</hi> 25.24,25,26,27,30. In warr, it is death for ſentinels to be taken ſleeping: and if in the Church, the watchmen of Chriſt, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the houſe, be ſupine, remiſſe, and drouſy, doe you thinke that Chriſt the <hi>maſter</hi> of the <hi>houſe</hi> will hold them guiltleſſe. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.7. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.34,35.</p>
            <p>2. From the fulneſſe of Chriſts authority, miniſters may be encouraged to diſcharge their function with <hi>confidence,</hi> and that touching the <hi>protection of their perſons, ſucceſſe and reward of their labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They may hence gather <hi>confidence,</hi> touching the
<hi>protection of<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168371:55"/>their perſons,</hi> ſo farr as Chriſt judgeth it convenient: for he that hath <hi>all power given unto him in heaven and earth,</hi> is able eaſily to put a reſtraint upon the greateſt power on earth, ſo that, if he think convenient, it ſhall not make the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
            <p>2. Miniſters may hence learne to be confident, touching the
<hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their labours:</hi> for he hath the key of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and can <hi>open</hi> unto them a <hi>great and effectuall door,</hi> though there are many adverſaries. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>If he ſet before the Angell of the Church of Philadelphia an open doore, no man can ſhut it, Rev.</hi> 3.8. If he give the Goſpell a paſſage, no man can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Miniſters may depend upon Chriſts ſoveraignty, for the <hi>reward of their labour.</hi> The recompence they have from the moſt of men, is contempt, affronts, and abuſes of all ſorts. But when the <hi>chiefe ſhepheard ſhall appeare, he is able to give them a crowne of glory, that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
5.4.</p>
            <p>2. There dwelleth in Chriſt, conſidered as the cauſe of our ſalvation, an <hi>all fulneſſe of ſufficiency,</hi> an <hi>all ſufficiency</hi> to effect it. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them, Heb.</hi> 7.25. In which words we have Chriſts
<hi>ſufficiency</hi> to carry on the worke of our ſalvation, affirmed, confirmed, and amplified, from the qualification of thoſe to whom it is actually effectuall.</p>
            <p>1. Affirmed: <hi>he is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> the phraſe may denote
<hi>three things,</hi> the <hi>perpetuity,</hi> the <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of</hi> the ſalvation, which he worketh, or elſe the <hi>perfection of his influence,</hi> or <hi>cauſality</hi> in the working of it.</p>
            <p>1. It may ſignify the <hi>perpetuity, and indeficiency</hi> of that ſalvation, which he worketh: <hi>He is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt of time,</hi> for evermore. He is not <hi>as Joſhua, Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, </hi> a temporary, but an eternall Saviour; he is able to ſave unto all eternity.</p>
            <p>2. It may import the <hi>abſolute perfection, and fulneſſe</hi> of the ſalvation, which he worketh: He is able to ſave unto the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree</hi> of ſalvation: he doth not ſave by halves, but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly, from every degree of evill, whether of
<hi>ſinne,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:168371:56"/>or <hi>miſery.</hi> And indeed there is not the leaſt degree in the ſalvation of true believers, that he leaves unaccompliſhed. <hi>He is the author and finiſher of their faith, Heb.</hi>
12.2. <hi>able to keepe that, which they commit unto him, againſt that day,</hi> 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1.12. as he hath <hi>begun a good worke in them, ſo will he performe, or finiſh it, Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>he will eſtabliſh their hearts unblameable in holineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> 1
<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. he will preſerve their whole ſpirit, ſoule, and body blameleſſe unto his coming,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
5.23.</p>
            <p>3. The forme of ſpeech may denote, (thinke ſome) the
<hi>perfection of Chriſts influence</hi> in the effecting of our ſalvation:
<hi>He is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt,</hi> that is, all manner of wayes, as a <hi>morall,</hi> as a <hi>phyſicall cauſe</hi> of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>1. He is the <hi>morall cauſe</hi> of our ſalvation, by the
<hi>merit of</hi> his humiliation, by <hi>the prevalency</hi> of his interceſſion, and by <hi>the light of</hi> his Doctrine and Example.</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>merit of his humiliation</hi> he hath purchaſed our ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. and ſo is the
<hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>2. His <hi>interceſſion</hi> for our ſalvation cannot but be prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe it is in the <hi>vertue and ſtrength of the all-ſufficient merit</hi> of the ſacrifice of his obedience for it. It is nothing elſe but the continuall preſentation thereof unto his father, and therefore is tearmed by ſome <hi>a preſentative oblation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, He is the <hi>morall</hi> cauſe of our ſalvation by the light of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi> 1 In his
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> he hath ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught the way unto ſalvation, that it is <hi>able to make wiſe unto ſalvation through faith in him,</hi> 2 Tim.
3.15. 2 By his <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> he hath as our forerunner, guide, as the
<hi>captaine of our ſalvation,</hi> ſo fully chalked out unto us the way unto ſalvation, as that if we follow him therein, it will bring us infallibly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>But now in the next place, he is not only <hi>a morall cauſe</hi> of our ſalvation by his <hi>merit, advocation, and example,</hi> but alſo <hi>a phyſicall cauſe,</hi> by his <hi>omnipotency:</hi> for by this he will remove all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, levell all mountains of oppoſition, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, put every believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>2. We have in this text Chriſts <hi>ſufficiency</hi> and ability to worke our ſalvation <hi>confirmed</hi> by <hi>two reaſons;</hi> one drawne from the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicableneſſe,</hi> the other from the

            <p>The Second <hi>reaſon is from the laſt act of</hi> his

            </p>
            <p>His exaltation, and raiſing of himſelfe unto a glorious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life, is a ſufficient argument, that he is <hi>able to ſave unto the uttermoſt.</hi> But can we conclude our ſalvation from his bare

<hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of Chriſt to worke ſalvation, is <hi>actually</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <hi>They muſt be ſuch, as come unto God by him.</hi> He will ſave unto the uttermoſt, <hi>all ſuch,</hi> and
<hi>only ſuch:</hi> and this affords matter for two uſes to be made of this head, one of conſolation, another of exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Uſe 1. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</note>The firſt of
<hi>conſolation:</hi> He will ſave to the uttermoſt <hi>every ſoule</hi> that cometh unto God by him, though before converſion rankt with
<hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the <hi>chiefe of ſinners;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. There is no ſnare of Satan ſo ſtrong, but he can breake it, no wound in the conſcience ſo deep, but he is able to cure it, no diſeaſe in the ſoule ſo inveterate, but he is able to heale it. His blood is ſo
<hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory</hi> unto Gods juſtice, as that it can waſh away the blackeſt guilt, ſo <hi>meritorious</hi> is it, that it can purchaſe a ſpotleſſe holineſſe, an <hi>eternall weight of undefiled, and unfading glory.</hi> Such is the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of his grace, as that it can ſubdue the moſt raging, and reſiſtleſſe luſts, it can reſiſt the ſtrongeſt, and moſt reſtleſſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>2. Here is an
<hi>exhortation</hi> to come unto God by Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168371:57"/>for he will ſave unto the uttermoſt <hi>only thoſe,</hi> that come unto God by him: that is, by a <hi>true faith, and unfeigned repentance, Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>John</hi> 6.35,37. by <hi>communion with him in worſhip,</hi> and by all acts of new obedience, <hi>Exod.</hi>
16.9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Micah.</hi> 6.7,8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Theſe alone are the perſons, which count the full ſalvation, which Chriſt hath wrought, <hi>worthy of all acceptation.</hi> As for thoſe who draw nigh unto God, only by <hi>profeſſion,</hi> in the uſage of outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, when all the while in their hearts and lives, by their unbeliefe, impenitency, and <hi>profaneneſſe,</hi> they keepe a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God, and Chriſt, They are great undervaluers, and ſcornefull ſlighters of his ability to ſave unto the uttermoſt. We may apply here that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great a ſalvation?</hi> How ſhall we eſcape damnation, if we neglect ſuch an <hi>all ſufficiency</hi> of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is treaſured up in Chriſt Jeſus? And doe we not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, if we will not ſo much as come unto him for it? nay, doe we not refuſe and reject it, if we walke in, and be delighted with thoſe pathes, and waies, that are oppoſite unto ſalvation, and lead directly unto hell, and damnation.</p>
            <p>This text gives little hope of ſalvation unto <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts:</hi> for the <hi>former cannot come unto God by Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are utterly ignorant of the name of Chriſt. And the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will not come unto God by him alone,</hi> they dare not adventure their ſalvation upon his <hi>ability,</hi> unto which the ſcripture gives ſuch a cleere, &amp; full teſtimony, but will depend in great part upon their own <hi>ſatisfactions,</hi> and <hi>merits,</hi> as alſo upon the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of <hi>ſaints,</hi> and Angels, which are but <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> idle and lewd fictions, and therefore cannot a jot be helpefull unto their ſalvation, but may indeed promote their damnation; nay the aſſertion of them throws ſuch a diſhonour upon the
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of ſalvation in Chriſt, as that I am ſure, it deſerveth in a very high meaſure damnation. But though I am thus peremptory touching the deſert of their doctrine, yet I ſhall leave the finall ſtate of their perſons unto the doome of their judge.</p>
            <p>There are divers formall, looſe, and profane
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe ſalvation is as (if not more) hopeleſſe, then that of<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168371:58"/>
               <hi>Papiſts:</hi> for God, and Chriſt, and unmortified luſts, unſubdued ſinnes, will never aſſociate, and therefore if we live, ſtay, and wallow in theſe, without repentance, we have not as yet drawn nigh unto thoſe. <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe? and what communion hath light with darkneſſe? And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14,15. God, and Chriſt then are unapproachable as long as we are in a ſtate of unrighteouſneſſe, in a ſtate of darkneſſe, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, utterly unacquainted with God, and Chriſt, as long as we are ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and Children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Beſides, comming unto God by Chriſt for ſalvation is ever accompained with <hi>ſelfe deniall,</hi> and therefore excludes all dependance upon any thing either in our ſelves, or any other creature. It is joyned alſo with <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> a due ſight, and deepe ſenſe of our loſt, &amp; lapſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our liableneſſe unto hell, and damnation. It is the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger, that makes men runne unto a remedy. Men will never be duely, and deepely ſollicitous for ſalvation, whoſe eies are not opened to apprehend, that if their ſoules be not ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus, they are undone for ever, and miſerable beyond all imagination; and that without a Chriſt there is an abſolute and utter impoſſibility of ſuch ſalvation. Such thoughts as theſe will quicken the addreſſe of a ſoule unto God by Chriſt for ſalvation, put life, vigour, and Zeale into it, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29,30. and make a man contemptive of all infortunities in compariſon of the loſſe, and damnation of his ſoule. For could we weigh, as the matter deſerveth, what an unvaluable loſſe that is, we would with patience brooke the greateſt miſeries, of which our <hi>outward man</hi> is here in this life capable, ſo we could be aſſured, that our
<hi>ſpirituall part</hi> might be <hi>delivered from the wrath</hi> to
<hi>come,</hi> ſo our ſoules might be ſaved, <hi>our darling, our only one</hi> be delivered from the power of the dog, the ſnare of Satan.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we may hence be exhorted unto <hi>zeale,</hi> and
<hi>conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in our worſhip and ſervice of, and obedience unto Chriſt. He hath <hi>ſaved us to the uttermoſt,</hi> and therefore it is but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that we ſhould <hi>ſerve</hi> him unto the
<hi>uttermoſt</hi> of both<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168371:58"/>our power, and time, with all our ſoules, might, and ſtrength. He hath done, nay ſuffer'd <hi>his utmoſt</hi> for our ſalvation, and ſtill he imployeth all his power, and intereſt, in heaven and earth for the promoting of this end. We ſhould then be very ungratefull wretches, if we ſhould not doe, and ſuffer <hi>our utmoſt,</hi> if called thereunto, for the advancement of his glory, eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> that we can doe, and ſuffer for him, is a poore <hi>inconſiderable nothing,</hi> in compariſon of what he hath done, and ſuffered for us. For our glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe he hath, and will lay out his whole time, even from his Incarnation unto the day of judgment: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is borne, unto us a ſonne is given, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. This was the ſcope of his <hi>humiliation</hi> and
<hi>exaltation, Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed againe for our</hi> juſtification: and for the compleating, and accompliſhing of this worke, he <hi>liveth for ever to make interceſſion.</hi> Now unto ſuch a peereleſſe love the leaſt returne we can make, is to be very carefull to miſ-pend none of our time unto the diſhonour, and diſſervice of ſuch a Saviour, to redeeme a good part of our time for his worſhip, to imploy all our time for his glory,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>I have been the briefer upon this fulneſſe, becauſe it is grounded upon ſome other fulneſſes of his, which follow, the
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> of
<hi>power,</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction, merit,</hi> and of <hi>glory,</hi> unto the handling of which we are in the next place to betake our ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt <hi>ſecondly may</hi> be regarded
<hi>abſolutely,</hi> as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, without relation unto any other thing, and ſo either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto his natures, or his <hi>twofold</hi> ſtate of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>exaltation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Chriſt may be look't upon according unto his <hi>natures</hi> and that both <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>humane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. According unto his <hi>divine nature,</hi> as he is God, and ſo there is in him all fulneſſe <hi>abſolutely,</hi> without reſpect, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon: ſo conſider'd, he is as a mighty ſea of being, and perfection; without banke, or bottome, in which are either <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>eminently</hi> all poſſible, and conceivable perfections: So conſidered, he is <hi>all-fulneſſe,</hi> and that is more then the
<hi>dwelling of all-fulneſſe in him.</hi> But this is not the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168371:59"/>
               <hi>fulneſſe</hi> here meant: for the fulneſſe agreeable to Chriſt, as <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>underivative,</hi> without a cauſe: He being poſſeſt of it, not by <hi>voluntary diſpenſation,</hi> but by <hi>naturall neceſſity,</hi> and ſo is not the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> in the text; that hath a cauſe, the decree and pleaſure of the father. <hi>It pleaſed the father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we conſider Chriſt, as <hi>man,</hi> ſo there was in him a <hi>threefold</hi> fulneſſe, the <hi>fulneſſe of the Godhead,</hi> the <hi>fulneſſe of grace,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſſe of power.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Againſt this expoſition I have theſe <hi>three</hi> following <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Theſe words, as is cleare by the particle <hi>(for)</hi> are a proofe or argument, to back, or enforce the exhortation of the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the foregoing words: <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoile you through Philoſophy, and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt: For in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the meaning of them be onely, that Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the ceremonies of the law, why then, they will not be an home, and adequate proofe. For they will onely conclude againſt the ceremonies of the law, <hi>the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world,</hi> and not <hi>reach Philoſophy, and the traditions of men.</hi> This expoſition then ſuites not with the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

               <hi>Zanchy.</hi> The fulneſſe of the Godhead, is never ſaid in ſcripture to dwell <hi>bodily</hi> in the ſaints or Angels: but it may be ſaid to dwell in them <hi>truely,</hi> and not <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically:</hi> and therefore <hi>bodily</hi> doth not ſignifie <hi>truely</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto the ſhadowes of the ceremonies under the law.</p>
            <p>3. This expoſition, as it is made to claſh with the ſecond, is needleſſe: for as our new Annotations on the place: <hi>the meaning is much at one, in whether of the two ſenſes we take the word. For God is ſaid in the Old Teſtament, to dwell in the tabernacle, Arke of the Covenant, and Temple, but onely as in the ſhadowes, and figures of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, which he ſhould take on him in the fulneſſe of time, to dwell in the ſame perſonally,<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168371:60"/>or really, and ſubſtantially with all his fulneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>a third</hi> expoſition, that maketh
<hi>bodily,</hi> to expreſſe the <hi>howſe, or Habitation,</hi> in which the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth: 'tis not onely the <hi>ſoule,</hi> but the <hi>body</hi> alſo. Whereupon his body is termed a <hi>temple, to wit, of the Deitie, Joh.</hi> 2.21. <hi>The perſonall union</hi> is not onely with the ſoule, but with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the fleſh of Chriſt. <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> Joh. 1.14. but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>ſubject,</hi> as the <hi>manner</hi> of this inhabitation, and therefore I ſhall ſay nothing farther of this ſenſe.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Second place,</hi> it is not <hi>eſſentiall,</hi> for all eſſentiall union of two natures, that is <hi>phyſicall,</hi> and reall, is of the <hi>forme</hi> with the <hi>matter:</hi> But now no ſuch Union can have place in the <hi>two</hi> natures of Chriſt, for the Godhead is a <hi>pure act, immutable,</hi> and <hi>independent;</hi> therefore it is blaſphemy to aſcribe ſuch imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto the Godhead, as to make it either the <hi>forme</hi> or <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the manhood.
<hi>Beſides,</hi> the reſult of an <hi>eſſentiall union</hi> is a
<hi>third nature,</hi> ariſing out of <hi>two</hi> partiall and incompleat na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but the Godhead and manhood of Chriſt, are two entire, perfect, totall, compleat natures; and therefore there can be no <hi>eſſentiall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> betwixt them. It remaineth then that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between them is onely <hi>perſonall, and hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> the <hi>bond</hi> whereof is the <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> or <hi>perſonality of the word:</hi> For the perſon of the word ſubfiſteth in both natures; it is but <hi>one perſon,</hi> that <hi>is God man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the farther proofe of this <hi>perſonall union</hi> betwixt the two natures of Chriſt, I ſhall alleadge but one Argument out of

Two natures, formes, or beings, which cannot be predicated of one another <hi>abſtractively,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alſo affirmed of one another in a <hi>concretive</hi> way, unleſſe it be by reaſon of an hypoſtaticall conjunction between them in one ſubſiſtence: But now the Godhead, or manhood of<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168371:61"/>Chriſt are two diſtinct formes, natures, or beings, whereof one cannot be affirmed of the other in an abſtractive predication. We cannot ſay, the <hi>Godhead</hi> is the
<hi>manhood,</hi> or the <hi>manhood</hi> the <hi>Godhead;</hi> but now we find in ſcripture, that in Chriſt, God is man, and man God, and therefore the Godhead and manhood are united in one perſon.</p>
            <p>For the fuller unfolding of this union, I ſhall deſire you to obſerve theſe two things in the text concerning it, <hi>the extreams</hi> and the <hi>manner of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The extreames of the union,</hi> the termes united; the
<hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> implied in the <hi>pronoune,</hi> in <hi>him;</hi> the
<hi>Godhead</hi> expreſſed unto the full, <hi>all the fulneſſe of the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We have the <hi>manner of the union,</hi> and that ſet forth
<hi>ab adjuncto,</hi> and <hi>a genere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By it's <hi>Adjunct,</hi> permanency, <hi>dwelleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By it's <hi>ſort,</hi> or <hi>kind:</hi> it is no
<hi>common,</hi> but a <hi>perſonall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation: <hi>dwelleth bodily;</hi> that is, <hi>perſonally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then we have the <hi>extreames</hi> of the union, the termes united, <hi>the Godhead</hi> and the <hi>manhood;</hi> the former

               <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard</hi> to another purpoſe. Whatſoever is predicated of Chriſt, agreeth unto him, either according unto his <hi>divine nature,</hi> or according unto his <hi>humane nature,</hi> or according unto
<hi>both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Now none will affirme, that the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelleth bodily in Chriſt according unto both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:168371:61"/>Neither can it be ſaid to dwell in him, according unto his <hi>divine nature.</hi> For then the Godhead would dwell in it ſelfe, and there would be no diſtinction between the dwelling, and the dweller. Whatſoever is in the Godhead is <hi>eſſentiall</hi> thereunto, is it's very eſſence, and therefore cannot be ſaid to dwell in it. For nothing can be ſaid to dwell in that, with which it is really the ſame. It remaineth therefore, that the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in Chriſt according unto his <hi>humane nature.</hi> His Humane nature is the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it were, of the Deitie, being aſſumed into a fellowſhip of ſubſiſtence with it, in his perſon. Beſides, (as the <hi>ſame Author urgeth,</hi>) the ſcope of the Apoſtle is, to compare Chriſt with, and to diſtinguiſh him from the holy men of God, who were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt'; and to ſhew that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth otherwiſe in him, then in them. In him he dwelleth <hi>perſonally;</hi> In them only in regard of
<hi>aſſiſtance, and energy.</hi> And from this ſcope of the Apoſtle it is evident, that the words are to be underſtood of Chriſt, as man. In them there may be <hi>a prolepſis,</hi> a prevention of an objection, that might be made, by the enemies of Chriſt, againſt the Apoſtles prohibition of all additions unto the Doctrine of Chriſt. Why muſt we, might they object, keepe ſo cloſe, and exactly unto the rule of Chriſt. Was he not a man? A man that was crucified? that died, and was buried? Had he not a ſoule and body, like us? Are there no men his ſuperiours, or equals? Are not the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> as wiſe and learned as hee? Are there not divers men as holy as he? why ſhould their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be rejected, and his precepts ſo inviolably obſerved? Had not <hi>Moſes</hi> immediate communion with God? what authority then hath he to abrogate that law, which <hi>Moſes</hi> received immediately from the mouth of God? Yea, but ſaith the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> though he were a man, yet he was not a <hi>meer man.</hi> Your eyes are not open; and therefore you ſee in him nothing, but his manhood. But we that have faith, the <hi>evidence of things not ſeene,</hi> can behold the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelling <hi>bodily</hi> in this man; that is, in his humane nature, which is ſo abject, and deſpicable in the eyes of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving men. <hi>Though he tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant,<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168371:62"/>and was made in the likeneſſe of men, and found in faſhion, as a man, humbling himſelfe, and becomming obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe, yet being in the forme of God, he thought it not robbery to be equall with God, Philip.</hi> 2.6,7,8.</p>
            <p>I proceede unto the <hi>ſecond extreame,</hi> or <hi>terme of this union,</hi> which we have expreſſed unto the full: <hi>All the fulneſſe of the Godhead.</hi> Here we may take notice of <hi>three gradations, the Gods head,</hi> the <hi>fulneſſe of the Godhead, All the fulneſſe of the Godhead.</hi> The latter ſtill being more

            <p>But this is not all, the Apoſtle goeth one ſtep higher, and in the third place ſheweth, that there is <hi>a numericall Identity</hi> betwixt the Godhead of Chriſt, and the Father; <hi>for in him dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead.</hi> There is not therefore one fulneſſe of the Godhead in the father, &amp; another in the ſonne, but <hi>all the fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>the Godhead,</hi> the ſame ſingular Deitie in both: and therefore they are one in eſſence. <hi>John</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my father are one:</hi> one <hi>God,</hi> though two <hi>perſons.</hi> The fulneſſe of the manhood in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>numerically</hi> different from that in <hi>Eve,</hi> and therefore they were <hi>two men.</hi> But the ſame ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the divine nature, that is in the Father, is in the Sonne. And therefore he is not only true, and perfect God, but one &amp; the ſame God (for <hi>number</hi>) with the father. And thus have I done with the
<hi>extreams of this union,</hi> the <hi>termes</hi> united, the <hi>mans hood,</hi> and the <hi>Godhead.</hi> Indeed the <hi>perſonall union</hi> is
<hi>proximè,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> only betwixt the perſon of the word, and the manhood, but <hi>mediately, and conſequently,</hi> it is of the two natures, as they are united in one perſon of the word.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be handled in the words, is, the <hi>manner of this union,</hi> and that is ſet downe from the <hi>adjunct,</hi> and from the <hi>ſort</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> of it. 1. From the <hi>Adjunct</hi> of it:

            <p>1.

            <p>To maintaine this interpretation, they are forced to faigne that there are two <hi>Metonymies</hi> in the words: that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his <hi>Doctrine:</hi> and the <hi>dwelling of allofulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily</hi> therein, for the perfect, full, and cleare

            <p>Now there is a <hi>rule</hi> for interpretation of Scripture, that ſhould never be violated: to wit, that we are not to run unto <hi>tropes</hi> and figures, as long as there is no abſurdity in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of words, according unto their proper, and native ſenſe, or ſignification. If we give way unto the violation of this <hi>rule,</hi> the greateſt part of Scripture may be eaſily wreſted from it's true intent and meaning, and perverted unto the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of errour, and eluded when urged for the maintenance of the truth.</p>
            <p>Yea, but they pretend, that there is abſurdity, in the proper acception of the words, and they have compelling reaſons from the <hi>text it ſelfe, and context,</hi> for their aſſigning of two <hi>metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> in the words.</p>

5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 437, 438.</note> is taken from the
<hi>impartibility,</hi> or <hi>indiviſibility of the Godhead. The Divine eſſence is impartible, and indiviſible, it hath no parts, ſo that whereſoever it dwelleth, it is full, and entire in all points. But now the Godhead, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, hath parts, for he mentioneth not ſimply the Godhead, but the fulneſſe, nay all the fulneſſe of it.</hi> And therefore, I believe, he would have the Reader collect, that the addition of <hi>all-fulneſſe</hi> were ſupervaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, if by
<hi>God-head</hi> were meant the eſſence of God. <hi>He for his owne part inferreth, that it ſignifies not the Divine eſſence, but the revelation of Gods will. In Philoſophy, in the traditions of men, and in the Moſaicall Law, the rudiments of the world, there were ſome few portions, or branches of Gods mind and will diſplayed; but in the Goſpel, in the doctrine of Chriſt, there dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead: that is, a moſt perfect explication of Gods will is comprehended</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. <hi>All-fulneſſe of the Godhead,</hi> doth no more<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168371:66"/>ſignifie parts in the Godhead, then it doth to ſay, that <hi>totus Deus eſt ubique,</hi> for God is onely
<hi>totum perfectionis,</hi> and ſuch a whole hath no relation to parts.</p>
            <p>2. As I ſhewed out of <hi>Zanchy, fulneſſe</hi> is aſcribed unto the Godhead of Chriſt, to ſignifie, that he is God
<hi>coëquall,</hi> and <hi>coëſſentiall</hi> with the Father.
<hi>All-fulneſſe</hi> is attributed unto the Godhead in him, to denote, that he is one and the ſame God, with the Father: and this expoſition excludes all parts, and diviſibility from the Godhead in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. Not onely the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> but alſo the
<hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> againſt whom our Apoſtle here dealeth, were not onely for <hi>integrall,</hi> but alſo for <hi>ſubjective</hi> parts of God. They maintained a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of God's <hi>maſculine,</hi> and <hi>feminine;</hi> they parcelled out, as it were, the perfections of the Deity unto their ſeverall Gods. In oppoſition unto them then, and their forged Deities, their <hi>Aeones,</hi> the Apoſtle might very fitly ſay, that in Chriſt there dwelled <hi>all-fullneſſe of the Godhead. Volkellius</hi> thinkes it cannot fall under the ſuſpicion of any, that the Godhead ſhould not be full, and that in <hi>all poynts,</hi> where it dwelleth. But he would have forborne this paſſage, if he had weighed what is ſaid of the Gods of the
<hi>Heathens</hi> by <hi>Heſiod</hi> in his <hi>Theogonia,</hi> as alſo what <hi>Eccleſiaſticall ſtory</hi> relates of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and
<hi>Valentinus,</hi> his <hi>Aeones.</hi> Nay we need not go ſo high, for the diſporoofe of this his aſſertion; for it may be convinced of untruth, and raſhneſſe, from the tenet of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who hold a
<hi>communication of the Divine properties</hi> unto the humanity, <hi>in part</hi> onely. For they give it onely <hi>omnipreſence, omnipotency</hi> and <hi>omniſcience,</hi> but not <hi>infiniteneſſe eternity</hi> and
<hi>ſimplicity.</hi> It hath been, you ſee, not onely the ſuſpicion, but the opinion, though erroneous, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, of divers in both primitive, and latter times, that the Godhead is communicable in part onely. The addition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>All-fulneſſe</hi> unto the Godhead is not unneceſſary.</p>

               <hi>Volkellius</hi> proceedeth from the <hi>ceheſion of the</hi> words, with thoſe foregoing. <hi>The all-fullneſſe of the Godhead, that dwelleth in Chriſt, is oppoſed unto doctrines, unto Philoſophy, the traditions of men, and rudiments of the world. But now there can be no congruous oppoſition betwixt the <pb n="131" facs="tcp:168371:66"/>divine eſſence, and doctrines. And therefore the divine nature is not here meant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer,</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is moſt falſe: for the Deity of Chriſt may very aptly be oppoſed, as the ſtrongeſt, and moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument we have againſt all <hi>additionall</hi> doctrines, unto the doctrine or goſpell of Chriſt. From the <hi>all ſufficiency of his perſon,</hi> in himſelfe, it is very obvious, unto any man of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable reaſon and underſtanding, to inferre, that there is an
<hi>all ſufficiency in his doctrine,</hi> and an <hi>all-fulneſſe</hi> in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If the divine eſſence dwell in him, then he needeth no ſupply from <hi>philoſophy,</hi> from <hi>traditions,</hi> and the <hi>law of Moſes.</hi> The Apoſtle might indeed have oppoſed unto theſe doctrines the fulneſſe, and perfection of Chriſt's owne doctrine, but he rather chooſeth to lead unto the fountain of all that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is in his doctrine, <hi>the all-fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelling in his perſon.</hi> This <hi>anſwere</hi>

            <p>1. If the manhood of Chriſt ſubſiſt any manner of way, then it is a perſon, or <hi>ſuppoſitum:</hi> for what is ſubſiſtence here, but ſuppoſitality, and therefore it, and

               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:168371:69"/>2. To exiſt in another perſon, and to
<hi>ſubſiſt,</hi> are oppoſite manners of exiſtence; for to ſubſiſt is <hi>eſſe per ſe, &amp; extra aliud omne ſuppoſitum.</hi> But the manhood of Chriſt doth exiſt in the perſon of the word, and therefore it cannot be ſaid to ſubſiſt. If theſe men would have conſulted their owne <hi>Suarez,</hi> he would have rectified this their miſtake, and have told them, how that uſuall ſaying. <hi>The humanity of Chriſt ſubſiſts in the perſon of the word,</hi> is to be qualified, to wit, in regard of its <hi>termination unto, and ſuſtentation</hi> by the ſubſiſtence of the word. For having propounded this objection, <hi>Dices, humanitas Chriſti non ſubſiſtit proprie, quia non eſt in ſe, ſed in alio.</hi> He frameth hereunto this anſwer. <hi>Reſpondetur, non ſubſiſtere, tanquam id quod ſubſiſtit: ſed proprie verbum in illa ſubſiſtit, &amp; illa dicitur in verbo ſubſiſtere, quia illius ſubſiſtentia terminatur, &amp; quaſi ſuſtentatur: in tert. part.

            <p>But now the <hi>Lutherans</hi> from this place argue, as for the communication of the properties of the Godhead in <hi>generall,</hi> unto the humanity of Chriſt, ſo more <hi>particularly</hi> for the communication of
<hi>omnipreſence</hi> thereunto, and their argument ſtands thus. <hi>That nature is every where, without which the all-fulneſſe of the Godhead is no where: But without the manhood of Chriſt the all-fullneſſe of the Godhead is no where, and therefore the manhood of Chriſt is every where.</hi> The
<hi>major</hi> is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable: and for the <hi>minor,</hi> it may be thus confirmed. All-fulneſſe of the Godhead is no where without that nature, in which it dwelleth allwayes, and every where bodily: But in the manhood of Chriſt all-fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth <hi>bodily allwaies, &amp; every where.</hi> If we ſhould ſay, that the all-fulneſſe of the Godhead doth not now at this preſent dwell <hi>bodily</hi> in the manhood of Chriſt here upon earth, it will then follow, that on earth it is out of it's howſe, and doth not actually dwell therein; and therefore it undeniably followeth, that the all-fullneſſe of the Godhead is no where without the humane nature of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>1. A <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the Godhead from the manhood; and ſo we readily grant it. The Godhead of Chriſt is no where Separated, or aſunder from the manhood, for unto this by meanes of the infiniteneſſe and ſimplicity of the Godhead, it is ſufficient, that they have ſomewhere
<hi>a joynt preſence.</hi>

            <p>But 2. as to be without the humane nature of Chriſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a <hi>deniall of incluſion in it,</hi> ſo we averre, that all fulneſſe of the Godhead is ſome where; (to wit, here on earth, and in many other places) without the manhood: for it doth not dwell therein, as a
<hi>thing contained in a place containing.</hi> So that the manhood is not coextended with the Godhead, and hath not the ſame amplitude of preſence with it. And this diſtinction applied unto the <hi>firſt ſyllogiſme,</hi> is a ſufficient ſolution unto the objection.</p>

But the perſon of the word is every where, therefore alſo the humanity of Chriſt is every where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Divines</hi> generally out of <hi>Damaſcene</hi> affirme, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the perſon of the word are united, not onely
<hi>inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> but alſo <hi>indiſtantly,</hi> therefore one of themis not diſtant from the other; but one of them would be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtant from the other, if one of them ſhould be every where, and the other onely in a certaine determinate place.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwere:</hi> the <hi>major</hi> is moſt falſe: for we ſee even in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that where there is no ſeparation betwixt the tearmes or extreames of an union, that yet the union is not by way of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168371:70"/>
               <hi>exequation, or equipatency:</hi> In a living man, the foule is not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the head, and yet the head doth not exiſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ſoule doth; for then it ſhould be in the feete. A ſtarre is inſeparably conjoyned with it's orbe, but becauſe it is leſſe in quantity, then it's orbe, therefore it is not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it's orbe is.</p>
            <p>So the God head and manhood of Chriſt are united
<hi>inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,</hi> and <hi>indiſtantly,</hi> but it doth not therefore follow, that the manhood being finite, is in point of preſence commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate unto the Godhead, which is infinite.</p>
            <p>Yea, but they argue for this, not onely from the
<hi>inſeparabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the union, but alſo from the
<hi>indiviſibility, ſimplicity,</hi> and <hi>impartibility</hi> of the Godhead. In the manhood of Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>all-fullneſſe of the Godhead,</hi> the whole manhood is united unto the whole, indiviſible, and impartible Godhead, and therefore it is whereſoever the Godhead is, and that is every where.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer;</hi> the conſequence is falſe; and the falſehood of it the learned Mr <hi>Barlow</hi> illuſtrateth by divers particulars. <hi>Exercit. Metaph.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 177, 178, 179. This preſent day hath a coexiſtence with whole eternity, that is ſimple, and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But the duration of this day is not adequate unto the duration of eternity. Eternity was before this day, and it will be for ever after the period of this day. So the manhood of Chriſt is united in heaven, where it exiſteth, unto the whole indiviſible Godhead, but it doth not thereupon enſue, that it coexiſteth with the Godhead in all places beſides. The humane nature of <hi>Peter</hi> is preſent unto the Godhead in ſuch a determinate ſpace, but it would be madneſſe for any man hereupon to inferre, that becauſe the Godhead is indiviſible, therefore, if
<hi>Peter</hi> doe <hi>preſentially</hi> coexiſt in one ſpace with it, therefore in all other ſpaces whatſoever. The whole indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſoule is united with the head, and ſo long, we cannot ſay, that it is any where ſeparated from the head, but yet, it would be a groſſe abſurdity for any man to ſay, that the head is preſent, whereſoever the ſoule is, for then it ſhould be where the hands, feete, and all the other members are. So the whole entire Godhead is no where<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168371:70"/>ſundered from the manhood, and yet the manhood doth not adequate it's immenſity. And this is ſufficient for <hi>anſwere</hi> unto <hi>the firſt Syllogiſme.</hi> As for the <hi>ſecond Syllogiſme,</hi> I deny the <hi>minor:</hi> to wit, that
<hi>all-fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in the manhood every where:</hi> all fullneſſe of the Godhead <hi>is</hi> every where; but it doth not
<hi>dwell in the manhood</hi> every where.</p>
            <p>The <hi>hypoſtaticall union</hi> may be conſidered
<hi>terminatively,</hi> or <hi>informatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Terminatively, in regard of Termination:</hi> and ſo it is terminated unto the perſon of the ſonne, and in his perſon unto all-fulneſſe of the Godhead, which is every where. It filleth heaven and earth with it's preſence. But now if we conſider it <hi>informatively,</hi> in regard of <hi>information,</hi> or <hi>inheſion</hi> (taking the word largely) ſo it is ſeated in the humane nature, that is not every where, but onely in heaven, at the right hand of God.</p>

               <hi>Albertinus Corall. tom.</hi> 2.
<hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Theolog. circa quintum Corallar: de ſubjecto unionis hypoſtaticae. That the hypoſtaticall union regards, and affects the word only extrinſecally, as it's terme, and that it reſpects the manhood only intrinſecally as it's ſubject.</hi> This is the common opinion of
<hi>Schoolemen, and for it Albertinus</hi> thus diſputeth. <hi>If the hypoſtaticall union be intrinſecall unto the word, it muſt be either created, or uncreated. It cannot be created: For this would inferre a change in the Godhead: neither can it be uncreated, becauſe actuall union hath ſuch an incompleate being, as is dependant upon, and eſſentially related unto ſomething elſe, and therefore utterly inconſiſtent with that infinite perfection which is in an uncreated being:</hi> The <hi>hypoſtaticall union</hi> therefore is not <hi>intrinſecall,</hi> but
<hi>extrinſecall</hi> unto the <hi>allofulneſſe of the Godhead</hi> in Chriſt. Well, <hi>this promiſed,</hi> the abſurdity, and irrationality of what theſe men have aſſerted is apparent.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Altingius:</hi> The union of the two natures can no where exiſt out of it's <hi>ſubject,</hi> but the humane nature is the
<hi>ſubject,</hi> in which it is placed, and therefore impoſſible for it to exiſt, where the manhood is not. The manhood is not every where, and therefore the union is not every where, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168371:71"/>the manhood is not every where united, but onely there, where the manhood hath it's exiſtence; for denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the union only followeth the exiſtence of the union: It doth not, It cannot denominate, where it is not.</p>
            <p>2. Then for the Great <hi>Hooker: whereas, he ſaith, that the conjunction of the manhood with Deitie, is extended as farre as Deitie, that the body of Chriſt is joyned unto Deitie, whereſoever Deitie is, that his Bodily ſubſtance hath every where a preſence of true conjunction with Deitie.</hi> This alſo is eaſily refuted upon the ſame ground, as that of
<hi>Altingius</hi> was. For however the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the manhood with the Deitie, reſpects the Deity as <hi>a tearme unto which it is,</hi> yet it regards the manhood alone, as the <hi>ſubject in which it is.</hi> And therefore it is extended as farre as the manhood onely, and not as farre as the Deitie, in which it is not at all. And hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that the body of Chriſt cannot poſſibly be joyned unto the Godhead, where the body is not. It cannot have <hi>a preſence of conjunction,</hi> where it hath not a
<hi>preſence of exiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall adde one thing more, and then, I ſhall have done with what I have to ſay in refutation of theſe worthy Gentlemen. The
<hi>hypoſtaticall union</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of <hi>School-men,</hi> is <hi>modus ſubſtantialis,</hi> not a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall entity,</hi> but only a <hi>ſubſtantiall manner of being,</hi> and the <hi>res modificata of it,</hi> the thing, which it modificates, is the humanity of Chriſt. But now it is utterly impoſſible, that <hi>modus,</hi> a manner of being ſhould have any exiſtence out of or apart from the Thing, which it modificates. Thus figure cannot exiſt ſever'd from quantity:
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bication, a re ubicata; duratio, a durante; ſeſſio, a ſedente.</hi> The ſubſiſtence, or perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a finite narure, cannot exiſt without that nature. The Papiſts, who in order unto their monſter of <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> hold it poſſible for
<hi>accidents</hi> to exiſt ſeparated from their <hi>ſubjects,</hi> yet are unanimous in affirming, that <hi>mods</hi> cannot poſſibly by the divine omnipotency exiſt ſunder'd <hi>a rebus modificatis.</hi> All this being <hi>preſuppoſed,</hi> let any, that is tender of the reputation of Mr
<hi>Hooker,</hi> tell me, what probability of coherence there is betwixt theſe <hi>two propoſitions</hi> of his, <hi>that<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168371:72"/>the actuall poſition of Chriſt's manhood, the res modificata, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reſtrained, and tyed unto a certaine place; and yet that the modus, the conjunction thereof with the Deitie, is extended as farre as Deitie.</hi> I ſhall illuſtrate what I have ſaid, by inſtancing in the <hi>union of the ſoule</hi> with the head of a man, which though it be <hi>terminated unto</hi> the ſoule, is onely <hi>placed in</hi> the head, <hi>tanquam ſubjecto,</hi> or rather, <hi>re modificatâ.</hi> Therefore this union is commenſurate unto the preſence of the head, and cannot be ſaid to be extended as farre as the ſoule, which is <hi>tota in toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in qualibet parte.</hi> Though then the ſoule, which is in the head, be in all the other members, yet we cannot ſay, that it is united with the head in them. As for the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſimilitude, the reader may eaſily ſupply that out of what hath been already delivered.</p>
            <p>That, which occaſioned this miſtake in <hi>Altingius,</hi> and Mr <hi>Hooker,</hi> was (as I ſuppoſe) their conceite, that if the manhood be not every where united with the perſon of the word, and therein with the Godhead, that then the perſon of the word, and the Godhead may be ſaid ſomewhere to be ſeparated from the manhood. This is apparent by the whole
<hi>ſeries</hi> of <hi>Altingius</hi> his diſcourſe, and no leſſe ſeemeth to be imported by this following paſſage in <hi>Hooker,</hi> premiſed by way of proofe unto this his aſſertion: <hi>Becauſe this ſubſtance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is inſeparably joyned to that perſonall word, which by his very divine eſſence is preſent with all things, the nature, which cannot have in it ſelfe univerſall preſence, hath it after a ſort by being no where ſevered from that, which every where is preſent, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>Lutheran</hi> conceit, and very untrue; for from the infiniteneſſe, and ſimplicity of the word, it inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that if it be any where united with the manhood, that then it can no where be ſever'd therefrom; and we may illuſtrate it by that ſimilitude (which I have often alleadged) of the ſoule. We cannot ſay of the ſoule in the feet, that it is ſeparated from the head, becauſe the ſame indiviſible ſoule, that is in the feet, is <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> united with the head: and the union of the ſoule with the head is not in the feet, but in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:168371:72"/>the head onely: there is nothing touching this particular which I can thinke of, that remaineth unſatisfied, but only one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage more in <hi>Hooker,</hi> which I ſhall tranſcribe, and briefly reply unto.
<hi>In as much</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>as that infinite word is not diviſible into parts, it could not in part, but muſt needs be wholy incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and conſequently, whereſoever the word is; it hath with it manhood, elſe ſhould the word be in part, or ſomewhere God onely, and not man, which is impoſſible; for the perſon of Chriſt is whole, perfect God, and perfect man whereſoever, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer</hi> unto this, I offer theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. This <hi>objection</hi> is every way as forcible, for the
<hi>actuall poſition</hi> of the manhood every where, as well as for the
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of it with the Deity every where. And the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> from it thus argue for the <hi>ubiquity</hi> of the manhood. Chriſt is every where man, therefore every where he hath his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. For if ſomewhere he ſhould not have his manhood, he ſhould ſomewhere be man without his manhood, which is abſurd. But now Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> denyeth the
<hi>actuall poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the manhood every where, and yet his argument,
<hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> with due change, is as cogent for that, as for the
<hi>conjunction</hi> of it with the Deity every where.</p>
            <p>But beſides this <hi>anſwer ad hominem,</hi> in a
<hi>Second</hi> place, I anſwer <hi>directly,</hi> by denying the conſequence of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>If the word hath not with it the manhood, whereſoever it is, then it ſhould be ſomewhere not man:</hi> For becauſe of the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, indiviſibility, and infiniteneſſe of the Godhead, this is ſufficient ground to ſay, that the perſon of the word is every where man, if any where it be perſonally united with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Thus becauſe the reaſonable ſoule, being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, is
<hi>ſubſtantially</hi> united with the head, we may ſay of it, in all the members, that it is the <hi>forme</hi> of the head, and yet it's information of, and conjunction with the head, is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced onely in the head, and not extended unto any other member.</p>
            <p>3. If Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> had but conſulted the
<hi>Schoolmen,</hi> he would never have troubled his readers with this objection, unto which they give a perſpicuous anſwer. This

               <hi>propoſition,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Chriſt is every where man, is to be diſtinguiſhed. The particle, every where, may be referred unto either the predicate</hi> man, <hi>or the ſubject</hi> Chriſt. <hi>If it be referred unto the predicate, and the ſenſe of it be, that the manhood is every where, or that it is every where coupled with the perſon of the word, then it is falſe: as it is falſe to ſay, that Chriſt was man from everlaſting, and as it is falſe to affirme, that the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the head, whereſoever it exiſteth. But now, if we referre it to the ſubject, and the meaning of the propoſition be, that Chriſt, who is every where, is man, then it is true, and ſound for Chriſt is every where in regard of his perſon.</hi> But this will yield no advantage unto the opinion of Mr <hi>Hooker,</hi> that the union, or conjunction of the manhood with the Deitie is extended, as farre as the Deitie. If any one of the admirers of Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> thinke, that I have wronged their great patron of ceremonies in this diſcourſe, I ſhall be contented to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined by them, ſo they will doe it with <hi>arguments,</hi> and not with <hi>invectives.</hi>

<hi>From the humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>perſon of the word,</hi> and the Godhead, in which it ſubſiſted from all eternity.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>perſon of the word, from the ſimplicity, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unchangeableneſſe of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the ſimplicity of it. The word conſidered in it ſelfe is moſt ſimple, and uncompounded. But the reſult of it's union with the manhood is compounded: for that is nothing elſe, but <hi>Chriſt, or the word incarnate,</hi> the word ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the divine nature, in a <hi>connaturall way, per conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalitatem,</hi> and in the humane nature,
<hi>by aſſumption</hi> thereof. And Chriſt the word incarnate, conſiſteth <hi>proximè,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> of the manhood, and ſubſiſtence of the word, <hi>conſequently,</hi> and
<hi>mediatly</hi> of the divine and humane nature; and therefore it is compounded.</p>
            <p>But now this compoſition will be a great imbaſure unto the word: for in every compoſition there are <hi>parts compounding,</hi> that mutually perfect one another, and are of their owne nature, ordained to compound the whole. All which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are utterly repugnant unto the perfection of the word. For that is infinite; and therefore it cannot be a part: for then, it ſhould have an incompleate being: it cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the manhood: and laſtly, it cannot have any naturall tendency unto compoſition.</p>

               <hi>twofold compoſition: Hujus ex his, &amp; hujus ad hoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Hujus ex his. Such is the compoſition of man, of a body and ſoule, of which it conſiſteth intrinſecally as of parts. And this compoſition he rejecteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is thus compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, dependeth of it's parts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding &amp; is after them at leaſt in order of nature. But now the perſonality of Chriſt doth not depend upon the humane and divine nature as parts conſtituting it, neither is it after them in order of nature, nay it preexiſted unto one nature, to wit, the humane, and therefore the perſon of Chriſt is not compounded of the divine and humane nature, if we ſpeake of this kind of compoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſecond kind of compoſition, and that is</hi> hujus ad hoc, <hi>and it is not ſo properly a compoſition of a third thing out of the things united, as an adjoyning of one of the things united unto the other. And thus the perſon of the word after the incarnation may be ſaid to be compounded. For hereby, the humane nature is added unto the perſon of the word, and unto the divine nature in the unity of the ſame perſon. But now, he allo ſubdivideth this compoſition, which he tearmeth</hi> hujus ad hoc. <hi>For it is either by inherence of one thing in another, and ſuch is the compoſition of an accident with it's ſubject: or elſe by way of a ſuppoſitall dependance of one thing upon, and relation unto another: ſo that the one ſhould ſubſtantially inexiſt in the other, and the other ſhould terminate the reſpect and dependance of the former, which inexiſts, and after this latter manner the perſon of the word is after the incarnation compounded. Becauſe, whereas before, it ſubſiſted onely in the divine nature, after the incarnation, it by it's ſubſiſtence terminated the dependance of the humane nature,</hi> Thus he.</p>
            <p>A ſecond <hi>anſwere</hi> is given by <hi>Aquinas.</hi> That this compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not <hi>ratione partium,</hi> but <hi>ratione numeri, part.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>art.</hi> 4. His plaine meaning is, that the things reckoned up in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to wit, the perſonality, or ſubſiſtence of the word,<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168371:74"/>and the humanity, or the deitie, and humanity are not parts <hi>properly</hi> ſo called; for this would imply imperfection, and incompleatneſſe in the word: but yet they are things <hi>really</hi> diſtinct, and that in number,
<hi>ſubſtantially</hi> united together. And the union (thinks he) of things
<hi>really</hi> and <hi>numerically</hi> diſtinguiſhed, if it be not a meere <hi>aggregation,</hi> is ſufficient to make a compoſition, as the word may be taken in the moſt generall acception of it.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>third</hi> place, The <hi>Scotiſts</hi> out of
<hi>Bonaventure</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of a <hi>proper,</hi> and
<hi>improper,</hi> or <hi>ſimilitudinary compoſition.</hi> They grant, that the perſon of the word after the incarnation, is compounded, taking the word compoſition in a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>improper ſenſe.</hi> But then they utterly deny, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in ſtrictneſſe, and propriety of ſpeech.

               <hi>Rada</hi> objecteth, <hi>all proper compoſition is of an informing act, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſive power. But now if we compare togeither, the perſon of the word, and his humanity, or the Deitie, and the humanity, as united togeither, they cannot be thus related one unto another. For the perſon of the word, and the divine nature, in which it ſubſiſts, is a moſt pure act, and therefore nec informari, nec informare poteſt. Adde hereunto, that that, which is compounded of parts properly ſo tearmed, is better, and more noble then each of the parts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, conſidered ſingle, and apart by themſelves. But Chriſt, the word incarnate, cannot be more noble, then the word conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red praeciſe, as it was in it ſelfe from all eternity: for it was of infinite perfection, and there can be no greater perfection, then that which is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> who doe moſt eagerly contend, that this is a compoſition properly ſo called, doe yet ſo refine the word, and take it in ſo <hi>abſtractive</hi> a ſenſe, as that it excludes all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.<pb n="148" facs="tcp:168371:75"/>Indeed the imperfections mentioned in the
<hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Rada</hi> are peculiar unto <hi>ordinary,</hi> and
<hi>naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi> But this (ſay they) is an
<hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall compoſition,</hi> of which we have no more but this one inſtance; and therefore it is not to be meaſured by them. <hi>Cajetan</hi> is here very wary, and modeſt: For he dares not ſay <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply,</hi> that the perſon of the word after the incarnation is compounded, but thinkes it fit to allay, and moderate the harſhneſſe of the expreſſion, and to ſay that it is a perſon compounded after an ineffable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>As for mine owne part, I muſt needs profeſſe, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the difference betweene them to be onely a <hi>Logomachy,</hi> a ſtrife of words, proceeding from an itch in theſe <hi>two ſects</hi> to quarrell whereſoever they meet. And therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it is not worthy any long digreſſion. The <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> yield unto the
<hi>Thomiſts</hi> that which theſe call a proper compoſition; to wit, an union of the perſon of the word, and the Dietie therein with the humanity. They confeſſe that the word, as incarnate, may be ſaid to be compounded in this ſenſe, that it ſubſiſteth, as in the divine nature, which is
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> and <hi>intrinſecall</hi> thereunto, ſo in the humanity which is <hi>extraneous,</hi> as it were <hi>forreigne,</hi> and
<hi>adventitious</hi> unto it; And this is all the compoſition, that the
<hi>Thomiſts</hi> argue for. The controverſy then is onely <hi>de modo loquendi:</hi> and yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> are favoured by the
<hi>notation of the word.</hi> For according unto that, <hi>compoſitio</hi> is <hi>quaſi poſitio cum alio:</hi> And <hi>compoſitum</hi> is
<hi>quaſi cum alio poſitum.</hi> Now the manhood and Godhead of Chriſt are put togeither, and that not by <hi>aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> but in a way of

<hi>as Chriſt, as incarnate, as ſubſiſting in two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> may under this reduplication be ſaid to be after the manhood, and to depend upon it; for it is the <hi>totall and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate tearme,</hi> which reſults from the union thereof with the perſon of the word, and the Godhead therein: And it is diſtinguiſh't from the word, conſidered <hi>praeciſe,</hi> with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, which is tearmed <hi>diſtinctio includentis ab incluſo:</hi> For it includes more then the word, to wit, the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond objection</hi> is taken from the
<hi>compleatneſſe</hi> of the word.

And therefore the adding

<hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> but <hi>accidentall.</hi>

            <p>A <hi>third argument</hi> is fetch't from the
<hi>unchangeableneſſe</hi> of the word. The word was God, and it is impoſſible for God to be changed. But now the word ſhould be changed by the incarnation, or <hi>perſonall union,</hi> becauſe there by it ſhould be made <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> man, whereas before it was not man.</p>

<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>pag.</hi> 82, 83, 84. whither I ſhall remit the reader.</p>
            <p>1. Another <hi>argument is</hi> taken from <hi>the Godhead,</hi> in which<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168371:76"/>the Perſon of the word ſubſiſteth.
<hi>All-fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> is common unto all the three Perſons; and therefore, if it be <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically</hi> united with the manhood, in the Perſon of the Son, it is alſo united therewith in the ſame manner in the two other Perſons, and conſequently, we may ſay of the Father and holy Ghoſt that they are incarnate.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer,</hi> I deny the conſequence: and my reaſon is, Becauſe <hi>all-fulneſs</hi> of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, not as it is conſidered <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>at large,</hi> as it is common unto all the three Perſons, but as it is taken
<hi>relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>determinately,</hi> as it is determined unto the Perſon of the Sonne. The Godhead is united with the manhood only as it is in the Perſon of the Sonne. Indeed the incarnation, or aſſumption of the humane nature, being an <hi>outward worke of the Trinity,</hi> belongs unto all the three Perſons <hi>effectivè,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of effection; It is the effect of all of them: for the ground and reaſon of efficiency is omnipotency, and that is common unto the whole Trinity. But it is peculiar unto the Sonne, as it is conſidered <hi>terminativè,</hi> in regard of it's
<hi>termination,</hi> and <hi>relation.</hi> The ſecond Perſon then, is the alone <hi>tearme,</hi> unto which the humane nature is aſſumed. Becauſe the ground and reaſon of this <hi>termination,</hi> is the perſonality, or ſubſiſtence of the word, which is proper unto it, and incommunicable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>two</hi> other perſons. All <hi>three</hi> Perſons did
<hi>joyntly</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividedly</hi> frame and ſanctify the manhood, as alſo did unite it with the Godhead: But it was only the Perſon of the word, that was united therewith. Thus <hi>the word alone</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be made fleſh,</hi> Joh. 1.14: <hi>to be manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>to take on him the forme of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2.7: <hi>the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Heb. 2.16: <hi>to take part of fleſh and bloud,</hi> Heb. 2.14. <hi>The Father is greater then the Sonne,</hi> Joh. 14.28. that is, as touching the manhood. But now this would not be true, if the Father were incarnate, and did ſubſiſt in the manhood, as well as the Sonne. It is therefore evident, that the whole Trinity was not incarnate.</p>

<hi>objections</hi> proceed on the manhood's part, and they are taken from the

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Debaſed:</hi> Becauſe it is affirmed to want the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and utmoſt complement of the humane nature, which is connatural thereunto, and found in all other men.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Violenced:</hi> For here by it is deprived of it's proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, unto which it hath a natural propenſion, or tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore it exiſts violently in the perſon of the word.</p>
            <p>But neither of theſe pretended abſurdities are the ſequel of this <hi>perſonal union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Hereby, there redounds no imperfection unto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, but rather exaltation, and advancement: For notwithſtanding it, Chriſt wanted nothing, to make him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, becauſe he hath a perfect humanity, unto which is communicated a ſubſiſtence, infinitely tranſcending it's own; and therefore it is in the Perſon of the word after an higher manner, then if it had ſubſiſted by it ſelfe.

            <p>And thus have I in ſome meaſure explained, and cleared this great myſtery of the <hi>perſonall union.</hi> There remaineth nothing then, but to make ſome briefe <hi>uſe,</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. It may ſerve for <hi>terrour</hi> unto all the obſtinate, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent enemies of Chriſt Jeſus, though never ſo great, and powerfull, here on earth: For their enmity is moſt fooliſhly directed againſt a perſon, that every way is infinitely their ſuperiour; <hi>in whom dwelleth all fullneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> And therefore, he is <hi>God, the living God, the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> He is God, and none elſe: and therefore, unto his name every <hi>knee ſhall one day bow, and all that are incenſed againſt him, ſhall be aſhamed, Iſay.</hi>
45.22,23,24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. He is the living God, therefore, <hi>it is a fearfull thing to fall into his bands,</hi> to be obnoxious unto his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.31. He is the Lord, how <hi>dare we then provoke him to jealouſy. Are we ſtronger then he,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>He woundeth and killeth, neither is there any that can deliver out of his hand, Deut.</hi> 32.39. <hi>He is able to deſtroy ſoule and body in hell fire, Math.</hi> 10.28. He is the Lord of Hoſt's, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>if his hand be ſtretched out, who ſhall turne it back, Iſay.</hi> 14.27. Becauſe he is the Lord of Hoſts, therefore, as you may ſee, in <hi>Iſay.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15. compared with, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:168371:79"/>9.32,33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He will be for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, for a gin, and a ſnare,</hi> unto ſuch of his adverſaries, as are finally impenitent: Be they never ſo great and powerfull, He will be <hi>as a ſtone,</hi> and a rocke to daſh, and ſplit them in pieces. Be they never ſo crafty, and ſubtile, He will be for a
<hi>gin, and a ſnare,</hi> to catch, and entangle them, unto their eternall deſtruction. We may apply here, that of <hi>Ely</hi> to his ſonnes, 1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If a man ſinne againſt the Lord, who ſhall entreate for him.</hi> He that ſinneth with a high hand, preſumptuouſly and impenitently, againſt the Lord Chriſt, ſinneth againſt his judge; and therefore, none can mediate for his peace, and reconciliation.</p>
            <p>2. This <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>perſonall union</hi> is a ground of unconquerable comfort, and unextinguiſhable joy, unto the Church in
<hi>generall,</hi> and all the members of Chriſt in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> They are related unto one of the greateſt perſons, that is a perſon, that is <hi>God as well as man,</hi> and therefore, <hi>a rewarder of them that ſeeke him, Hebr.</hi> 11.6. <hi>rich in mercy, Epheſ.</hi> 2.4.
<hi>Excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of juſtice, Job.</hi>

               <hi>power is not idle, but conſtantly working in equity and juſtice for performance of promiſes, and threatnings, for defending his people and puniſhing his enemies. The man, who is our ſhepherd, is fellow unto the Lord of Hoſts, Zechar.</hi> 13.7. and therefore <hi>He is Jehovah, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and therefore we may with <hi>David,</hi> be confident, that <hi>we ſhall never want &amp;c.</hi> Pſ. 23. <hi>He is the Sonne of God, therefore his bloud cleanſeth from all ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>therefore the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt his Church, Math.</hi> 16.16, &amp; 18. <hi>He is the firſt borne of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Col.</hi> 1.15. therefore they, that are his, need not dread the malice and oppoſition of any creature. VVhen <hi>Zennacharib,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> brake in with his forces, like a deluge upon the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> overwhelming it from one ſide unto another. The prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> upon this account, that it was the land of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> a land intereſted in Chriſt, who being God from all eternity, became one with us in the fulneſſe of time, bids, and as it were proclaimeth a defyance unto all the aſſociations, preparations, conſultations, and<pb n="157" facs="tcp:168371:79"/>reſolutions of their adverſaries. <hi>Now therefore behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

And he ſhall paſſe thorow Judah, he ſhall overflow, and go over, he ſhall reach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even to the neck: and the ſtretching out of his wings ſhall fill the breadth of thy land, o Immanuel.

Take counſel together, and it ſhall come to nought: ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand; for God is with us,</hi> Iſaiah. 8. verſ. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The ſame Prophet, having propheſied of the future enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and advancement of the Church, by the converſion of the Gentiles, <hi>chap.</hi> 54. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3: in the <hi>fourth verſe,</hi> he <hi>dehorts</hi> from doubt, and diſtruſt of the fulfilling of this his prophecy, aſſuring them, that their expectation thereof ſhould not be fruſtrated. And whereas the maine diſcouragements of their hope were, their reflection on their ſervitude in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were, as it were, in their <hi>youth,</hi> Jer. 2.2. Ezek. 23.3: and their preſent ſenſe of their <hi>widdowhood,</hi> that is, deſolate condition by the <hi>Babylonian bondage,</hi> the Prophet promiſeth them ſuch a glorions eſtate for the future, as ſhall drown the memory of all their former reproach, and miſery. <hi>Fear not, for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed: neither be thou confounded, for thou ſhalt not be put to ſhame: for thou ſhalt forget the ſhame of thy youth, and ſhalt not remember the reproach of thy widdowhood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the argument, by which he laboureth to erect their faith, and hope, touching the performance of all this, is the Deitie of Chriſt:
<hi>For thy maker is thy husband, (the Lord of hoſts is his name) and thy Redeemer the holy one of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called,</hi> verſ. 5.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Church is eſpouſed unto her Maker, therefore no creature ſhall hurt her; Nay all the creatures, as there is occaſion, ſhall be ſerviceable unto her. Becauſe the holy one of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth, is her Redeemer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe may confidently expect a full deliverance: for with<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168371:80"/>him is <hi>plenteous redemption, ſo that he will redeem his Iſrael from all he

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iquities,</hi> Pſal. 103. verſ. 7, 8. And from the bondage of corruption into the <hi>glorious liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21.</p>
            <p>The Prophet (you ſee) makes the Godhead of Chriſt, the foundation of the Churches happineſs, and that in the moſt calamitous condition of warre, and captivity: And for it we have a very good argument from the mouth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29,30: where he aſſerts the certainety of the ſalvation of all his ſheep, from his <hi>coequality or coeſſentiality</hi> with his Father: in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, he gives us the <hi>character</hi> of his ſheep, They are ſuch as obey his doctrine, and imitate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>my ſheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Hereupon he promiſeth them eternal life, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in faith: and <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> verſ. 28. They are in his hands, under his paſtoral care, and protection, and no man or Devil can take them from him, can break off, or interrupt either totally, or finally their union with him. This he maketh good by a <hi>compariſon</hi> of himſelfe with his Father, in regard of <hi>power. My Father, which gave them me, is greater then all: and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. I and my Father are one,</hi> verſ. 29, 30. The Father is more powerful then all the creatures, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and all his inſtruments; and therefore none can pluck the ſheep of Chriſt out of the Fathers hands. And if they be in the Sonnes hands, they be in the Fathers to o, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.10.</p>
            <p>But now Chriſt aſſumeth that he is one with his Father, in regard of <hi>eſſentials: I and my Father are one,</hi> verſ. 30. and therefore he is as powerful as his Father: He is whatſoever his Father is, as touching his <hi>eſſence,</hi> and can doe whatſoever his Father can doe.
<hi>What things ſoever the Father doth, theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth the Sonne likewiſe,</hi> Joh. 5.19. Hereupon then it undeniably followeth, that all the men on earth, all the Devils in hell, are not able to pluck ſo much as one of his ſheep out of his hands.</p>
            <p>That the fulneſs of the Godhead in Chriſt is a ſtorehouſe of bleſſings, that never can be emptied, I ſhall yet farther evidence,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168371:80"/>by a brief view of the <hi>names, attributes,</hi> and
<hi>workes of God,</hi> and their <hi>application unto Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then, as touching the names of God, and their attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Chriſt, together with the comfort, that hereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds unto the people of Chriſt, I ſhall deſire the Chriſtian Reader to peruſe, and conſider theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>In his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved and Iſrael ſhall dwel ſafely, and this is his name, whereby he ſhall bee called, The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> Here, we have a name of God, given unto Chriſt, <hi>Jehovah the Lord,</hi> and the
<hi>ſalvation and juſtification</hi> of the Church depending upon, and reſulting from this name.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The ſalvation in general</hi> of the Church depends upon this his name. Becauſe he is Jehova, the Lord; therefore, <hi>in his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely.</hi> Which words of the <hi>Prophet</hi> may be paraphrazed by thoſe of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> Math. 1.21. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>A particular branch of ſalvation</hi> depends upon this his name. Becauſe the branch of <hi>David</hi> is the Lord, therefore he is able to juſtifye us, to be our righteouſneſs. <hi>This is his name, whereby he ſhall be called, the Lord our righteouſneſse:</hi> Which words may be expounded by thoſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is made of God unto us righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this place we may aptly conjoyne <hi>Iſai.</hi>
45.22,23,24,25: for that it is meant of Chriſt, a compariſon of
<hi>verſ.</hi> 23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10 will eaſily demonſtrate. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth For I am God, and there is none elſe. I have ſworne by my ſelfe, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe, and ſhall not returne, that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear. Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſſe, and ſtrength. In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>name</hi> of God given unto Chriſt is the <hi>Lord of Hoſts:</hi> and how comfortable the attribution of it unto Chriſt is, may be cleared from theſe <hi>two</hi> following ſcriptures. The
<hi>firſt is Iſai.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelfe, &amp;c. and he ſhall be for a Sanctuary, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe he is the Lord of Hoſts, therefore he is a ſanctuary, which none can violate, a ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. That the Perſon there ſpoken of is Jeſus Chriſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<pb n="160" facs="tcp:168371:81"/>not be queſtioned by any true Chriſtian. For <hi>Simeon</hi> in <hi>Luke. Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> applieth the latter part of the 14 <hi>verſe</hi> unto him, and that ſpeaks ſtill of the ſame Perſon, which the former part doth. Agune in
<hi>Zech.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Becauſe he is the Lord of Hoſts, ſent by the Lord of Hoſts, therefore he aſſureth the Church of the Jewes, that after their own glorious reſtitution, they ſhould enjoy a full victory over their enemies, unto whom for the preſent, they were vaſſals, and ſervants: And that this victory ſhould be gained very eaſily on his part, as it were with the ſhaking of his hand, or lifting up of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And hereupon, he exhorts them to triumph, ſing, and rejoyce: and he back's his exhortation from a promiſe of his preſence in her, of the conjunction of the Gentiles with her, and of his government of her. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For behold, I will ſhake my hand upon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoile to their ſervants: and ye ſhall know that the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent me. Sing and rejoyce, o Daughter of Sion, for lo, I come, and will dwell in the midſt of thee, ſaith the Lord. And many nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that day, and ſhall be my people: and I will dwell in the midſt of thee, and thou ſhalt know, that the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent me unto thee. And the Lord ſhall inherit Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah his portion in the holy land, and ſhall chuſe Jeruſalem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To go from the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> unto the <hi>New,</hi> and there, I ſhall ſingle out but one place at preſent, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.
<hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 20. where he is tearmed the <hi>true God;</hi> and his being ſo, is a reaſon of the ſaving illumination of the regenerate, as alſo of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the ſinne unto death, and protection againſt the temptations of Satan. <hi>We know, that whoſoever is borne of God, ſinneth not: But he that is begotten of God, keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that the Sonne of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true, even in his Sonne Chriſt Jeſus. This is the true God, and eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Proceed we <hi>next,</hi> from the <hi>names</hi> of God, unto his <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:168371:81"/>and conſider we what comfort, the aſcribing of them unto Chriſt, doth miniſter. I ſhall at preſent inſtance onely in his <hi>eternity immutability, omnipreſence omnipotency, &amp; omniſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then for his <hi>Eternity. Becauſe his goings forth have been from of old from everlaſting, therefore the remnant of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhall returne unto the Children of Iſrael. And he ſhall ſtand, and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the majeſty of the name of the Lord his God, and they ſhall abide: for now ſhall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And this man ſhall be the peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into the land, and when he ſhall tread in our palaces, Micah.</hi> 5.2,3,4,5. If he had beene but a meere man, if his coming forth had beene onely from
<hi>Bethlehem Ephratah,</hi> he had been utterly unable to have accompliſht any of all this. He could not have brought in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles,
<hi>the remnant</hi> of his brethren, and have joyned them unto the believing
<hi>Iſraelites:</hi> He could not have <hi>fed them:</hi> that is, he could not have made proviſion for them: He could not have governed, and protected them: He could not have been <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> unto them againſt the dreadfull fury of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> invaſion. Our Saviour Chriſt having aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.51. that whoſoever <hi>kept his ſayings</hi> in his heart by faith, in his life by obedience, ſhould enjoy eternall life. The Jewes preſently oppoſed him herein, and the matter is argued <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> between Chriſt and them,
<hi>ver.</hi> 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57. and at laſt Chriſt cloſeth up the diſputation with affirmation of his eternity, <hi>ver.</hi> 58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> Becauſe he was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore, if a man keep his ſayings, he ſhall never ſee death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that perſon in whom dwelleth <hi>all fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily,</hi> is <hi>immutable;</hi> and this
<hi>immutability,</hi> we have moſt clearly, and fully predicated of Chriſt in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 102.26,27. (If we will allow the <hi>Apoſtle Paul, Heb.</hi> 1.10,11,12. to be a competent interpreter of the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) and the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof is in conjunction with two other excellencies of the divine nature: one but now mentioned, <hi>Eternity, ver.</hi> 24. The other preſently almoſt to be inſiſted on; the
<hi>creation of all things, ver.</hi> 25. From all which he concludeth the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, indeficiency, and unbarrenneſſe of the Church, <hi>ver.</hi>
28.<pb n="162" facs="tcp:168371:82"/>1. He affirmeth the <hi>eternity</hi> of Chriſt. His duration is coëx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the duration of all the creatures, <hi>Thy yeares are throughout all generations. Next,</hi> he ſignally aſſerts his creation of all things, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Of old haſt thou laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth: and the heavens are the worke of thy hands.</hi> And
3. As for his unchangeableneſſe, he doth not barely affirme it, but illuſtrate it alſo, by a <hi>compariſon of diſſimilitude;</hi> with the change of thoſe creatures which ſeeme moſt exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from mutation,
<hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, yea, all of them ſhall waxe old like a garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed. But thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall have no end.</hi> And from all this, he draweth this concluſion, that the Church of Chriſt ſhall ſtill, in all ages, be fruitfull, and bring forth children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>The children of thy ſervants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee, ver.</hi> 28. Where, by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſeed of the ſervants of God, he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch, as deſcend from them by <hi>carnall propagation,</hi> but ſuch as retaine their faith, and imitate their piety. Becauſe Chriſt is Eternall, omnipotent, unchangeable, therefore his Church, which is conjoyned with him by an indiſſoluble bond, ſhall be perpetuall, and never totally faile from off the earth, never be extinguiſhed by the greateſt calamities, that are incident unto mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>all fulneſſe of the Godhead</hi> dwell in him, then alſo <hi>omnipotency. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is borne, unto us a ſonne is given, who is the mighty God, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. And this is brought by the Prophet, as an argument for confirmation of thoſe ſweete, and precious promiſes of conſolation, redemption, and ſubduing of enemies, whereby he goeth about to comfort the godly and faithfull in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that in the utter devaſtation and depopulation of their country, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. In reference unto his omnipotency it is, that God ſpeaking of him in the Pialmiſt, ſaith, <hi>I have laid help upon ont that is mighty, Pſalm.</hi> 89.19. that is, <hi>mighty to ſave, Iſai.</hi> 63.1. <hi>able to ſave unto the uttermoſt, Heb.</hi>
7.25. Hence is it alſo that he is ſtiled by <hi>Zachariah an horne of ſalvation:</hi> that is, a ſtrong and mighty Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69.
<hi>one that is able to doe exceeding<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168371:82"/>abundantly above all that we can aſke or think, Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>able to keepe our ſoules, which we have committed unto him,</hi> 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1.12. <hi>able to keepe them by his power through faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>omnipreſent.</hi> He was in heaven, as <hi>God,</hi> when, as <hi>man,</hi> he converſed with men here upon earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. and therefore <hi>he is a very preſent helpe in trouble, Pſalm.</hi> 46.1. Though the heavens muſt receive his manhood, untill the time of reſtitution of all things, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.21. Yet as
<hi>God</hi> he ſits on the throne in the Chriſtian Churches, here on earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. and will be with the faithfull miniſters thereof, unto the <hi>end of the world, Math.</hi> 28.20. and he will be in the mid'ſt of all aſſemblies of her members gathered in his name, <hi>Math.</hi>
18.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> if there dwell in him <hi>all-fulneſſe of the Godhead,</hi> then alſo <hi>omniſcienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: He knew what was in the heart of man, Joh.</hi> 2.25. <hi>He knoweth all things, Joh.</hi> 21.17. <hi>He is the wonderfull counſeller, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. And therefore can foreſee, and diſappoint all deſignes: and machinations againſt his Church, and Goſple. His people need not feare the depths of Satan, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.24. for with him there is an ineffable
<hi>depth of the riches both of wiſdome and knowledge, unſearchable judgments,</hi> and <hi>waies paſt finding out, Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
            <p>To paſſe on from the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, <hi>unto his workes,</hi> I ſhall at this time make mention of <hi>two,</hi> the
<hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>preſervation</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>2. Then, the <hi>creation of all</hi> things is attributed unto Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3,10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and therefore, we <hi>may commit the keeping of our ſoules unto him in well-doing, as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatour,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>2. The preſervation of all things is attributed unto him. <hi>By him all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1.17. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his power, Heb.</hi> 1.3. Therefore, he can preſerve by the power of his grace, all his people from totall, and finall defection, and <hi>keep them by his power through faith unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. He
<hi>can put his feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him, Jerem.</hi> 32.40. Enough hath been ſaid to prove, that the <hi>perſonall union</hi> is a ſufficient argument<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168371:83"/>for the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt, to carry on his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of ſaving the ſoules of ſuch, as belong unto the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a ſecond place,</hi> it is alſo a proofe of his
<hi>Willingneſſe and readineſſe</hi> to do the worke. <hi>Can two</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>walke together, except they be agreed; Amos</hi>
3.3. So may we ſay, can the Godhead dwell in the manhood, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Godhead intend reconciliation with ſome perſons in the manhood; to wit, the men, which the Father had given unto the Son out of the world, <hi>Joh:</hi> 17.6,9. God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, and yet the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in the humanity of Chriſt; and therefore, we may ſhape an affirmative anſwer unto the queſtion propounded by the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chapt. 33. v. 14. and may ſay that ſome among the ſons of men ſhall dwell with the devouring fire, ſhall dwel with the everlaſting burnings. The cohabitation of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with the manhood, in the perſon of Chriſt, is a full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that as it is <hi>Revel.</hi>
21.3. <hi>the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people: And God himſelfe ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> Such an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the Sonne of God, would never have <hi>aſſumed</hi> us unto himſelfe, in his incarnation, if his deſigne had not been to have <hi>communicated</hi> himſelfe unto us, by making us his houſe, his ſanctuary, his holy temple, his habitation through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. in which he will dwell and walke. <hi>The high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, who dwelleth in the high and holy place,</hi> would never have <hi>dwelt and tabernacled amongſt us, Joh.</hi>
1.14. never have <hi>dwelt in the fleſh,</hi> unleſſe it had been his gratious purpoſe, to <hi>dwell with him alſo, that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit;</hi> To <hi>revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones, Iſay</hi> 57.15. <hi>The perſonall union</hi> (you ſee) conſidered ſingle by it's ſelfe, is a very high demonſtration of Chriſt's love unto mankind: But it is capable of farther am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, and exaggeration by compariſon with his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſufferings in our nature. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid downe his life for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. Becauſe Chriſt, who was God, laid downe his life for us: becauſe he, in whom dwelled all fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168371:83"/>himſelfe unto the ſhamefull, and painfull death of the croſſe, unto the curſe of the law, and the wrath of God; and that for us, that harboured nothing, but thoughts of hoſtility againſt him. This therefore ſpeaks ſuch a matchleſſe eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of love, as is beyond the comprehenſion of either men, or Angels. To diſtruſt the conſtancy, and future expreſſions of ſuch a love, is a high piece of ingratitude. Seeing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo infinitely great and glorious, hath done, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much for the
<hi>purchaſe</hi> of our ſalvation, we may therefore collect, that it was his abſolute decree, to apply, and conferre the ſalvation, thus purchaſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to accompliſh all things requiſite for the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof. <hi>He will make knowne the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, Rom.</hi>
9.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from the <hi>perſonall union,</hi> we may be
<hi>dehorted</hi> from embaſure of our natures by <hi>ſin. The relative preſence of</hi> God in the midſt of his people, was uſed as an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt not only <hi>Morall,</hi> but alſo <hi>Leviticall</hi> and
<hi>Ceremoniall</hi> uncleanneſſe, <hi>Defile not the land, which ye ſhall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell amongſt the Children of Iſrael, Num.</hi> 35. <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto mee, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the ſoles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midſt of the children of Iſrael for ever, and my holy name ſhall the houſe of Iſrael no more defile, neither they, nor their Kings, by their whoredome, nor by the carcaſſes of their Kings in their high places, Ezek.</hi> 43.7. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſaying, Command the Children of Iſrael, that they put out of their camp every leper, and every one, that hath an iſſue, and whoſoever is defiled by the dead, &amp;c. that they defile not their camp in the midſt whereof I dwell, Num.</hi> 5.1,2,3. Now this <hi>relative preſence</hi> is nothing almoſt, in compariſon of that <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> and
<hi>perſonall</hi> preſence of the Godhead, in Chriſt's humane nature; and therefore, that is a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall <hi>diſſwaſive</hi> from the pollution of ſin. <hi>There can be no greater grace ſhewed towards man, then that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to unite to mans nature the perſon of his only begotten ſon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hooker. p</hi> 297</note> We
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168371:84"/>ſhould then be very mindleſſe of, and unthankfull for Gods thus gracing, and exalting of our nature, if we ſhould by ſinfull luſts, &amp; corruptions, defile our natures, which are for <hi>ſort, or kind</hi> the ſame with that of the only begotten ſon of God.</p>
            <p>4. From this <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>perſonall union</hi> we may, <hi>firſt,</hi> be <hi>exhorted</hi> unto the <hi>worſhip of Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Directed</hi> in our <hi>worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We may hence be <hi>exhorted</hi> unto a divine worſhip, and a religious adoration of him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5,6. <hi>Chapt.</hi>
5.8,12,13,14. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 7.9,10. the fulneſſe of the Godhead in him is the <hi>ultimate, formall, and adequate object of divine worſhip,</hi> and calls for a divine faith, and truſt in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29.
<hi>John.</hi> 14.1. <hi>John.</hi> 16.9. As alſo for ſuch an height of love, as cannot be given unto a meere creature, without Idolatry, <hi>Luk.</hi>
14.26. Becauſe he is the Lord, therefore <hi>ſerve him with feare, and rejoyce with trembling. He is the ſon, therefore kiſſe him leaſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, Pſalm.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>He is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him, Pſal.</hi> 45.11. <hi>He is the Lord of Hoſts, therefore ſanctify him, and let him be your feare, and your dread, Iſai.</hi> 8.13. <hi>He is God, and none elſe,</hi> therefore <hi>let every knee bow unto him: let every tongue ſwear by him, Iſai.</hi> 45.22,23. <hi>He thought it not robbery to be equall with God, Phil.</hi> 2.6. And therefore, <hi>let us honour him, even as we honour the father, Joh.</hi> 5.23. <hi>He is God over all,</hi> and therefore, let <hi>him be bleſſed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>He is the mighty God, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. therefore let us <hi>humble our ſelves under his mighty hand,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>He is worthy to receive glory, honour, and power, for he hath created all things, Revel.</hi> 4.
<hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. From the <hi>perſonall union,</hi> we may take
<hi>direction</hi> for our worſhip of God. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under the old teſtament were to bring all their holy thinges, their offerings, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices before the Altar, and Tabernacle, and afterwards the Temple, the habitation of Gods howſe, and the place, where his honour dwelt,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 16.13,14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5,6. They were to pray, and worſhip towards the city, which God had choſen, and towards the howſe, the holy temple, which God had built for his name, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi>
8.35,44,48. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Dan.</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:168371:84"/>6.10. But now the Arke, tabernacle, and temple were but <hi>types</hi> of Chriſt's manhood, and the preſence of God in them was but <hi>typicall.</hi> In the manhood it ſelfe, there is a <hi>perſonall preſence</hi> of the Godhead. And therefore, we ſhould bring all our <hi>duties,</hi> and
<hi>ſervices,</hi> all our <hi>acts of worſhip</hi> unto Chriſt,
<hi>man,</hi> and preſent them in his name, and through his mediation: that is, in our performance of them, we ſhould eye <hi>Chriſt man,</hi> as the
<hi>inſtrument,</hi> and <hi>morall cauſe, meriting of, and interceding</hi> for their acceptation. From above the mercy ſeate, where God dwelt <hi>typically,</hi> betwixt the Cherubims, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 80.1.2
<hi>Kings</hi> 19.15. there God communed with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and met with his people; <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42,43. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.89. And this was to teach, that all the <hi>approaches</hi> of Gods people unto him, and all <hi>acts of their communion</hi> with him in faith, hope, love, prayers, prayſes, hearing of the word, and receiving of his ſacraments ſhould be in Chriſt, our alone mercy ſeate, or propitiation, 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. as the <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of their acceptance: For in him onely dwelleth <hi>all-fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily;</hi> and therefore, in him alone, for his ſake meerely, will God be well pleaſed with our perſons, and ſervices, all the worſhip, and honour, that we tender him.</p>
            <p>For farther <hi>application</hi> of this point, I ſhall referre the reader unto what I have ſaid on <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. and for the preſent, I ſhall onely diſpatch the conſideration of thoſe
<hi>inferences,</hi> that the Apoſtle himſelfe drawes from it in this place, in the <hi>words foregoing and following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the words foregoing. <hi>Beware, leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vaine deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt: for in him, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 8. which words, I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> expound in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>then</hi> ſhew the inference of them from the dwelling of all-fulneſſe of the Godhead in Chriſt bodily.</p>
            <p>1. Then, to expound the words briefely in themſelves; They are an <hi>exhortation</hi> unto a carefull and heedefull eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of ſeduction by any additionals unto the doctrine of Chriſt. In them we have two <hi>things</hi> eſpeciall remarkable 1. the <hi>danger.</hi> 2. The
<hi>meanes</hi> of ſuch <hi>ſeduction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>danger of</hi> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a <hi>ſpoiling</hi> of the ſoule. The word<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168371:85"/>is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it ſignifieth <hi>to drive away,</hi> as a prey, or bootie. Thoſe, that ſeduce from Chriſt, by additions unto his Goſpell, are the worſt of thieves, or robbers: For they plunder men of truth and faith, of God and Chriſt, grace and glory; They carry away their ſoules from the fold of Chriſt, as a prey to be devoured by Satan. Beſides, it is not a ſimple theft, but a kind of ſacrilege, for it ſpoileth the ſoule, that was made after the Image of God, and conſecrated, as a temple unto God, and reedeemed from Satan for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, by the bloud of him, in whom dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</p>
            <p>2. We have the <hi>meanes</hi> of ſuch ſeduction, the impoſtures, or wiles, by which ſeducers withdraw men from Chriſt,
<hi>Philoſophy and ſuperſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Philoſophy: Beware leſt any man ſpoile you through phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy:</hi> where, by <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> is underſtood either the
<hi>abuſe of</hi> true Philoſophy; and that is, when matters of faith are ſubmitted unto the tribunall of reaſon: when the myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion are tyed, and judged by the dimme light of nature: or elſe 2. the <hi>erroneous, though curious ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of</hi> ſome
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> which were by the <hi>Gnoſtickes,</hi> and other
<hi>Heretiques,</hi> brought into Divinity. Such perhaps might be the dotages of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> touching <hi>Angels,</hi> that they created the world, were mediatours between God and men; and therefore, were to be worſhipped. This philoſophy is the ſame with that <hi>ſcience, falſely ſo called,</hi> of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi>
6.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſecond</hi> impoſture, or wile, by which ſeducers draw men from Chriſt, is <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> tearmed here, by the
<hi>Apoſtle, vain deceit.</hi> And unto this interpretation I am lead by theſe 2. conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe theſe words, <hi>vaine deceit after the tradition of men,</hi> have a great ſimilitude, as in ſound, ſo in ſence and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, with that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeakes of the ſuperſtition of the <hi>Phariſees, Math.</hi> 15.9. <hi>In vaine they doe worſhip me, teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Becauſe our Apoſtle in the purſuite of his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168371:85"/>of theſe ſeducers, diſputes againſt ſeverall branches of ſoperſtition <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23. and expreſſely nameth <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> which is the ſame with ſuperſtition. I know the generality of interpreters thinke this clauſe to be added <hi>appoſitivè, or expoſitively,</hi> to explaine what is meant by Philoſophy. The Apoſtle doth not condemne all philoſophy, but onely that, which is vaine, and deceitfull: And then the particle
<hi>(and)</hi> is as much as <hi>even,</hi> or, <hi>that is. Beware leſt any man ſpoile you through Philoſophy,</hi> that is, <hi>vaine deceit.</hi> I doe not deny, but that (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) is many times redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or uſed only <hi>expoſitively,</hi> but I ſuppoſe that is, when there is ſome abſurdity in it's ſignifying a diſtinct thing. But now there can be no pretence for any ſuch abſurdity here, and therefore not to take it, as a <hi>conjunction copulative,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſtinct thing, would be to offer violence unto the text.

            </p>
            <p>In the words, we have <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> deſcribed from
1. <hi>it's effect,</hi> deceit. 2. <hi>adjunct,</hi> vaine. 3. <hi>rule,</hi> and that is ſet downe 1. <hi>poſitively, and abſolutely; After the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world.</hi> 2.

For God will reject all ſuperſtitious uſages in his worſhip, with a great deale of indignation. <hi>Who-hath-required theſe things at your hands Iſai.</hi> 1. And then unto an illight ned, and awakened conſcience, reflection on them will afford nothing, but matter of terrour and repentance. The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>vanity; vaine</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:168371:86"/>deceit. And <hi>vaine</hi> it is 1. Becauſe <hi>empty,</hi> in that it is not accompanied with the grace of God: For God ſanctifieth onely his owne ordinances. 2. Becauſe

            <p>A ſecond <hi>rule</hi> of this ſuperſtition, which the Apoſtle would have them to beware of, is <hi>the rudiments of the</hi> world; that is, the ceremoniall lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as appeares by collation of this place, with <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21. of this chapter: as alſo with

<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. By this you ſee, that thoſe, who preſſe the antiquated, and abrogated ceremonies of the Moſaicall law, are ſeducers, that carry away the ſheepe of Chriſt from his fold, as a ſpoile, a prey, or bootie, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we have theſe two rules of ſuperſtition, the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and the rudiments of the world, ſet downe
<hi>adverſatively,</hi> by way of <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition:
<hi>And not after Chriſt:</hi> that is, they are not after the doctrine, or commandement of Chriſt. Whatſoever is not after Chriſt, that is, according unto the doctrine of Chriſt, in the Goſpell, is againſt Chriſt; and therefore, vaine deceit. The uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedneſſe of a worſhip is ſufficient to brand it for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Nadab and Abihu offered ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, Levit.</hi> 10.1.
<hi>They have built the high places of Tophet &amp;c. Which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. Jerem.</hi> 7.31.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen the words expounded <hi>in themſelves,</hi> I ſhall in the next place briefely diſpatch the <hi>inference</hi> of this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from the dwelling of all-fulneſſe of the Godhead in him bodily, implied in the particle <hi>(for): Beware leſt any man ſpoile you through philoſophy and vaine deceit, after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt; for in him dwelleth all fullneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> From the <hi>fulneſſe of the Deitie,</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt, we may conclude <hi>the fulneſſe, perfection, and all-ſufficiency of his doctrine.</hi> And conſequently the danger, vanity, and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<pb n="172" facs="tcp:168371:87"/>of all additions thereunto whatſoever, whether <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh philoſophy, Phariſaicall, or Popiſh, the traditions of men, or Judaicall, the rudiments of the world.</hi> What ſeducers can more ſpoile the flock of Chriſt, then the patrons of ſuch additionals: For they withdraw from all fulneſſe in the God head, unto that which is but vaine deceit. They lead from the fountaine of living waters, unto broken ciſternes, that can hold no water. The Philoſophy of the Gentiles hath indeed a ſhew of wifedome, but it was but folly, and thick darkneſſe, compared with the wiſdome of Chriſt.

The higheſt perfection of the ſaints of God, is, to be pantakers of the divine nature, to have the Godhead dwell in them <hi>operatively,</hi> in regard of it's gracious effects.

It is no leſſe therefore then a treaſonable preſumption, for men to revive thoſe lawes, which he hath repealed, to preſſe thoſe obſervances, which he hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Interpreters upon the place, generally make this obſervation upon the coherence, that the Apoſtle giveth this generall refutation of thoſe
<hi>three impoſtures</hi> before ſpecified, that they are not according unto the doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>not after Chriſt,</hi> to ſhew that this conſideration alone is ground enough to reject any doctrine, or part of worſhip.

They would never dare to preſume, to attempt any ſupply unto the unſearchable riches, or fulneſſe of wiſedome, the manifold wiſedome of God, diſplaid in his Goſpell, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
3.10. In him dwelleth all-fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily; and therefore,
<hi>beware leaſt any man ſpoile you through Philoſophy and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt:</hi> The Deitie of Chriſt was the maine ground, why <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſeth in the behalfe of the reſt of the Apoſties, a reſolution to adhere conſtantly, and ſolely unto the doctrine of Chriſt,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.68,69. 1. He layeth downe two reaſons for adherence unto Chriſt's doctrine alone, 1. The alſufficiency thereof to inſtruct us in the way unto eternall life, and ſalvation. <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life, verſ.</hi> 68. and this he maketh good from the
<hi>alſufficiency of his office and perſon, verſ.</hi> 69. <hi>Thou art that Chriſt, the ſonne of the living God:</hi> Thou are not onely man, but God. <hi>The ſonne of the living God:</hi> therefore, thou art all-ſufficient to be our Chriſt, our Prieſt, King, and Prophet; and therefore thou haſt the words of eternall life. 2. We have the utter inſufficiency of all created perſons, to give us any light herein,
<hi>whither ſhall we goe, verſ.</hi> 68: that is, for the words of eternall life. Chriſt is the <hi>ſunne of righteouſneſſe, Mal.</hi> 4.2. &amp; therefore, will infallibly<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168371:88"/>guide us unto heaven. But if we forſake him, and follow any other light, it will prove like that of an
<hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> it will lead us into the ditch, into the bottomleſſe pit of hell.</p>
            <p>We may enlarge this uſe farther, and proceede <hi>ab hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi ad theſin:</hi> for the perſonall union of Chriſts Godhead with his manhood is a ſufficient argument, not only againſt the abuſe of philoſophy, traditions of men, and rudiments of the world, but alſo againſt all other <hi>additionals,</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſalvation, unto Chriſt whatſoever; and that in regard of any of his <hi>offices.</hi> Becauſe he is God man, Becauſe in him dwelleth all-fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, therefore he he is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt; therefore he is an all-ſufficient <hi>Prophet,</hi> able fully to inſtruct his Church; therefore he is an all-ſufficient <hi>King,</hi> able perfectly to governe his Church; therefore he is an all-ſufficient <hi>Prieſt,</hi> able fully to ſatisfy, and merit, and conſequently able throughly to intercede for his Church.

               <hi>Zanchy</hi> upon the words makes this collection, that whoſoever truely knoweth, that in Chriſt, <hi>man,</hi> dwelleth all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, that Chriſt<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168371:88"/>is true God, and one God with the father, that he is true man, he will acknowledge, that the fulneſſe of ſalvation is placed in Chriſt alone; and therefore, he will reſt upon Chriſt onely for ſalvation, and not ſeeke for it elſewhere. Indeed to ſeeke for it elſwhere is ſuch a piece of folly or madneſſe, as if a man, that hath a fountaine of living water in his owne garden, ſhould fetch water for his occaſions from ſtinking puddles: As if he that hath at home, in his owne houſe, a bottomleſſe mine of gold, and ſilver, ſhould ſearch for it over a vaſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, where he can find nothing, but worth-leſſe pebbles.</p>
            <p>To proceede in <hi>a ſecond place</hi> unto that, which the
<hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> in the <hi>words following</hi> inferreth, from the dwelling of all-fulneſſe of the Godhead &amp;c. in the humanity of Chriſt, <hi>And ye are compleat in him, which is the head of all principality and power, verſ.</hi> 10. In the words the Apoſtle collects from the
<hi>perſonall union</hi> two particulars. 1. The <hi>dignity</hi> of all Believers, the members of Chriſt. <hi>Becauſe in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily; therefore ye are compleat in him.</hi> 2. The <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Chriſt, in compariſon of the <hi>Angels. Becauſe in him dwelleth all-fulneſſe of the Godhead</hi> bodily, therefore <hi>he is the head of all principality, and power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He inferreth herefrom the <hi>dignity of</hi> all believers:
<hi>In him dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily: And ye are compleat in him.</hi> Here I ſhall 1. open the words in themſelves: And then 2. open the dependance of what is in them aſſerted, upon the <hi>perſonall union,</hi> The dwelling of all-fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily in the humanity of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall 1. explaine the words in themſelves.
<note n="n" place="margin">Secundum Graecorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem, &amp; vos in illo, tanquam capite, repleri eſtis divinitate; quatenùs ſcilicet dignitas capitis redundat in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.

               <hi>Some</hi> underſtand the words of the Godhead it ſelfe, dwelling in Chriſt, in as much as the dignity of the head redoundeth unto the body. What loving wife, but lookes upon the honour of her husband, as reflecting upon her ſelfe? And good ſubjects thinke themſelves intereſted in the exaltation of their ſoveraigne. The extraordinary eminence, and renowne of particular perſons, for proweſſe, piety, learning, or any other <hi>perſonall</hi> worth, is interpreted a credit, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:168371:89"/>honour unto their whole nation. Thus, we men ſhould thinke our ſelves concerned in the <hi>perſonall union,</hi> Becauſe therein our nature was advanced unto as great an height of honour, as it is capable of. It is (ſay the <hi>Schoolmen</hi>) of all unions of things
<hi>really</hi> different, the greateſt, and moſt excellent <hi>in genere unionis,</hi> and <hi>in genere doni.</hi> 1. <hi>In genere unionis;</hi> Becauſe it is a moſt ſtreight, cloſe, and intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of things, betwixt which there is an infinite diſtance; to wit, of a pure act, with a paſſive power; of the higheſt ſpirit, with the loweſt; may of the ſupreame ſpirit, with fleſh; of an uncreated perſon, with a created nature.</p>
            <p>2. It is greateſt, <hi>in</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Eſt i ſta natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae humanae tanta et tam celſa &amp; ſumma ſubvectio, ut quo attollere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur altius, non habet. Auguſt. de prae deſtinatione ſanctorum ca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.</note> 
               <hi>genere doni:</hi> It is the greateſt gift God can beſtow upon mankind; for therein God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates unto a created nature, that infinite, and uncreated perfection, which he hath in himſelfe, by communicating unto it a divine perſon, with a <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> and <hi>perſonall</hi> communication, then which no greater communication of the Deitie is imaginable.</p>
            <p>This is apparent, 1. <hi>Ex parte ipſius unionis,</hi> from the union it ſelfe. For this union placeth man in an higher ranke, and order, then any other ſupernaturall gift: for it maketh that man is God, which no other gift, either of grace, or glory, can performe.</p>
            <p>2. It is evident from the <hi>adequate</hi> tearme, reſulting from this union, which is <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For he is more perfect, then any creature whatſoever. There be ſome, that have but a very remote intereſt in, and little benefit by this ennoblement of our nature, to wit, the enemies of Chriſt and his Church: for unto them, without repentance, it will miniſter but matter of greater terrour. How will they be confounded, to ſee, that he, whom they have all their lives long oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is ſo great and glorious a perſon, in whom <hi>dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead? &amp;c.</hi> But now all true believers whatſoever, are nearely, and deepely concerned, and intereſted herein, 1. In regard of their intimate relation unto him; they are his <hi>members, friends, ſpouſe, bone of his bone, fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> 2. Becauſe this dignifying of his humanity by the <hi>hypoſtaticall union,</hi> was for their ſakes, to make them compleate, to perfect<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168371:89"/>their happineſſe, to render them righteous, and make them gracious, and glorious. This expoſition, though it containeth nothing but truth, yet I conceive, is not the ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this place. For the compleatneſſe here included in the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tranſlated <hi>compleat,</hi> or filled, denominates believers <hi>immediatly to be</hi> compleate,
<hi>impleate,</hi> or filled. But however Believers have intereſt in, and relation unto the dwelling of all-fulneſſe of the Godhead in Chriſt, yet the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the humanity of Chriſt, doth not immediately deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them <hi>compleat:</hi> For to aſſert that, would open a plaine way unto the errour of <hi>Oſiander,</hi> who held, that Believers are denominated righteous by the <hi>eſſentiall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt's Godhead.</hi> The groſſeneſſe of which tenet <hi>Gerhard loc. Com. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>de juſtificat. Chapt.</hi>
5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 195. <hi>pag.</hi> 677. proveth amongſt divers others by this conſideration, that if Believers may be called righteous, from the
<hi>eſſentiall</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, then alſo they may be denominated om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, from the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> omnipotency of the Deity. Indeed the fulneſſe of the Godhead denominateth believers compleate,
<hi>mediately,</hi> and <hi>cauſally:</hi> For it is the Cauſe, and ground of all their ſpirituall compleatneſſe, and ſupernaturall perfection: ſo that they may be ſaid to be compleat <hi>from it,</hi> though they cannot be ſo properly denominated compleate <hi>with it.</hi> But this cannot be the ſence of the words, without a <hi>metonymie:</hi> And in expoſition of ſcripture, we are not to flie unto <hi>tropes,</hi> unleſſe there be ſome abſurdity, if the words be taken <hi>properly;</hi> And what abſurdity is there, if by the <hi>compleatneſſe,</hi> or
<hi>fulneſſe,</hi> which is the <hi>abſtract</hi> of the
<hi>concrete</hi> compleate, or filled, in the text, we underſtand not the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelling in Chriſt, but a fulneſſe, or compleatneſſe derived, or communicated unto believers from Chriſt, with which they are truely inveſted, and which immediately denominates them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that goe this way to worke, in the expoſition of the place, are yet ſubdivided: For ſome <hi>reſtraine</hi> it unto the compleatneſſe of juſtification; Others <hi>enlarge</hi> it unto the whole perfection, which a Chriſtian participates from<pb n="178" facs="tcp:168371:90"/>Chriſt, unto the compleatneſſe, as of their juſtification, ſo alſo ſanctification, and glorification.</p>
            <p>1. Some <hi>reſtraine</hi> it unto the compleatneſſe of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers juſtification, and they thinke, that the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to declare, that the compleatneſſe or perfection, by which they are perfectly juſtified before God, lieth out of themſelves, in Chriſt.
<hi>Ye are compleat in him:</hi> that is, ye are compleate, <hi>not from him,</hi> by any inherent righteouſneſſe, for that is in this life incompleate, and imperfect; <hi>Iſay.</hi> 64.6.

            <p>As for that ſtale <hi>objection of the Papiſts: Every thing is, what it is, formally, by ſomething inherent in it ſelfe.</hi> Man then, cannot be <hi>formally</hi> righteous before God, with a righteouſneſſe that is in Chriſt, no more, then he may be denominated <hi>formally</hi> wiſe, from the wiſedome of another. This is by ſome revived againſt the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, with a great deale of eagerneſse, and violence, who yet looke upon themſelves as
<hi>Proteſtants of</hi> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forme, and take it in great ſnuffe, to be told by any of compliance with <hi>Papiſts</hi> herein. As for the argument it ſelfe, theſe men would never have thus troubled the world with it anew, if they had but ſeriouſly conſidered the anſwers, that are given by the generality of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hereunto. <hi>Two worthies</hi> of our owne nation, <hi>Abbot,</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> have given unto it ſo cleare, and full a ſolution, as I am confident will ſatisfy all impartiall, and unprejudiced readers.</p>

Formally juſt in qualitie is he, in whom is found the perfect inward forme and qualitie of juſtice and righteouſneſſe without ſpot or ſtaine; and thus it were abſurd indeed, to ſay, that a man may be formally juſt by the juſtice of another, becauſe the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent qualitie of one ſubject cannot become the inherent qualitie<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168371:90"/>of another. But in courſe of law and judgment, the forme of juſtice is not to be ſubject to crime or accuſation, and he is formally juſt, againſt whom no action or accuſation is liable by law. Now it is true indeed, that every one that is formally juſt in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is alſo formally juſt in law, but yet a man may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally juſt in law, who by inherent forme and qualitie is not juſt. For in this ſort a man becommeth juſt by pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, becauſe pardon being obtained, the law proceedeth no farther, and all imputation of the offence in law is taken away, as if it had never been committed. And this is the ſtate of our juſtice and righteouſneſſe in the ſight of God, that through the imputation of the merit and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt our ſinnes are forgiven us, and thereby no accuſation is liable againſt us, either as having done what we ought not to doe, or not done what we ought to do, according to the words of the Apoſtle, who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? If we reſpect inherent qualitie, there is enough to charge him with, but by forgiveneſſe of ſinnes the ſame becommeth as if it had never been. In a word therefore, we are not formally juſt in qualitie, if God judge us thereby, being ſtained and defiled in all the righteouſneſſe that we have; but we are formally juſt in law, by the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for that thereby a ſatisfaction is interpoſed, &amp; our ſins are remitted and pardoned, ſo that there is no let, but that God mercifully for his ſake accepteth us unto ever laſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the anſwere of <hi>Ames,</hi> it ſtandeth thus. <hi>Non aliâ ratione formalitèr nos juſtos nominari, &amp; eſſe dicimus, imputatâ Chriſti juſtitiâ, quam quâ is, cujus debitum ab altero ſolvitur, nominatur, &amp; eſt ab illo debito liber, vel immunis: &amp; quâ is, cui procuratus eſt alterius favor, aut graetia, nominatur, &amp; eſt illi alteri gratus. Haec autem fieri poſſe probatur ſatis ab experientiâ communi. Bellarm. enervat. tom.</hi> 4.
<hi>pag.</hi> 134. when we ſay, that we are righteous, and formally denominated ſuch, by the righteouſneſse of Chriſt imputed unto us, our meaning is no otherwiſe, then as when alſo we ſay, that a man is freed, or diſcharged from a debt, which is paid for him by another, or as when a man is ſaid to be gracious with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when this grace or favour is procured by a third perſon. And again in p. 135. <hi>exempla quae profert Bellar. denominationu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place, ſome extend the place, ſo as that they make it to take in the <hi>whole perfection</hi> of a Chriſtian, which is communicated, or derived from Chriſt, either by <hi>imputation</hi> or by <hi>reall infuſion,</hi> and ſo it may be paraphraſed by
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>God hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> with righteouſneſſe, grace, and glory. The intendment of the Apoſtle is to aſſert, that the cauſe, or Originall of all the compleatneſſe of a believer, is Chriſt Jeſus alone; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in him, is as much as, by him; (and ſuch is the ſignification of it elſewhere: as, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Ye are compleat in him:</hi> that is, ye are compleat <hi>for him, and from him:</hi> for his ſake, as <hi>a meritorious cauſe,</hi> purchaſing your compleatneſſe, and from his reall influence, as <hi>a phyſicall cauſe,</hi> working, and effecting your compleatneſſe. This ſence of the words is more <hi>comprehenſive</hi> then the former, and therefore to be embraced, if it be not otherwiſe liable unto any juſt exceptions, and whether it be ſo, I ſhall in the next place briefely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>1. How can Believers here in this life be ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as touching their ſanctification, ſeeing the counter-luſtings of the fleſh are an undeniable proofe of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer:</hi> Their ſanctification is compleat, and full, in regard of <hi>parts,</hi> though not <hi>degrees.</hi> Every believer receiveth from Chriſt's fulneſſe grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17.
<hi>Every one hath grace ſufficient,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. ſufficient for the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every luſt, and corruption; ſufficient to enable for the acceptable performance of every duty, neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> comparing <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Parmenio</hi> together, paſſeth this cenſure upon them: <hi>Multa ſine rege proſperè, rex ſine illo nihil magnaerei geſſerat.</hi> He proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly atchieved many things without <hi>Alexander: Alexander</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:168371:91"/>did nothing of moment without him. If we compare a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with Chriſt, we may ſay, that without Chriſt he can doe nothing at all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. whereas he can doe all things through Chriſt, which ſtrengthneth him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p>2. The like <hi>objection</hi> may be framed againſt the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Believers in this life, as touching their glorification: for though they have the firſt fruits and beginnings of glory, yet they are ſo overballanced by the unſpeakable miſeries of this life, as that
<hi>Paul</hi> doubted not to ſay, that they were <hi>of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> if their happineſſe were confined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this life, <hi>if in this life onely they had hope in Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p>For anſwer: 'Tis true, Believers are not compleat
<hi>actually,</hi> as touching their glorification, but yet they may be ſaid in reſpect of it, to be compleat <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>ſeminally;</hi> and for ſuch an aſſertion, we have the warrant of Scripture. <hi>He that believeth on the Sonne,</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>)
<hi>hath everlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 3.36. not onely <hi>ſhall have it,</hi> but <hi>hath it.</hi> He hath it already in the ſeed, and root of it. The grace of the Spirit in his heart is a <hi>well of water, that will ſpring up unto everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, Joh.</hi> 4.14. In this ſence he that hath the Sonne, hath the life of glory, as well as a life of righteouſneſſe, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. and ſo ground to rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. Looke as a man, that is an undoubted heire unto great riches, might be ſaid to be <hi>rich in reverſion,</hi> if he could be aſſured to live unto the enjoyment of it. So Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be ſaid to be compleat in regard of their glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe there is a <hi>certainty of their full fruition of it:</hi> for they are <hi>heires apparent</hi> of perfect glory. <hi>The God and father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath according to his abundant mercy, begotten us againe unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3,4.</p>
            <p>And this inheritance is made ſure unto them by an eternall, and immutable <hi>decree,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2.13. by an irreverſible, and unrepealable <hi>promiſe</hi> of an omnipotent God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. that can breake through all difficulties, and overcome all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168371:92"/>of it: As alſo by the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of an unvaluable <hi>price,</hi> by the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of an infallible ſpirit, <hi>ſealing them unto the day of redemption, Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. that is, deliverance from all bondage into the full liberty of the ſonnes of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. Believers then are happy, when others, nay themſelves judge themſelves in the very extremity of miſery, <hi>when they walke in darkneſſe and ſee no light, Iſaiah</hi> 50.10. There is you ſee, <hi>certitudo objecti;</hi> The future compleatneſſe of their glory is a thing certaine in it ſelfe: and there may be <hi>certitudo ſubjecti.</hi> Such believers as <hi>walke humbly with their God, Micah.</hi>
6.8. and <hi>purifie themſelves as he is pure,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3.3. may, and ought to reach that <hi>full aſſurance of hope,</hi> of which the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. upon this account it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that we are <hi>ſaved by hope, Rom.</hi> 8.
<hi>verſ.</hi> 24. that is, we are ſaved here in this life, not in regard of a <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>plenary poſſeſſion,</hi> or
<hi>fruition,</hi> but onely in reſpect of an <hi>aſſured expectation thereof.</hi> And thus I have ended with the expoſition of the words in themſelves. I am in the next place briefely to examine the <hi>inference</hi> of them from the foregoing. There dwelleth in Chriſt, as man, all-fulneſse of the Godhead bodily; therefore ye, who believe in Chriſt, are compleat in him; for he is able to make you compleat: Becauſe hereupon it followeth 1. that in all that he did, and ſuffer'd, there was an <hi>infinite merit,</hi> able to purchaſe this compleatneſſe. 2. That there was in him an
<hi>inſinite power,</hi> able to conferre this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe. Some underſtand thoſe words of our ſaviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. concerning the humanity of Chriſt, conſidered alone, without his Deitie. It is <hi>the ſpirit that quickneth:</hi> that is, it is the Godhead united unto the humane nature, that giveth ſpirituall life. <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing:</hi> that is, the humane nature of Chriſt, if it were diſunited from the divine, it would be of little availe unto the quickenance of our ſoules. Its concurrence is not onely profitable, but neceſſary; yet it is onely inſtrumentall; and therefore, in the vertue of it's principall agent, the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelling bodily in it. If Chriſt had beene meere man, though clothed with all the power, that a creature is capable of, He could not have ſaved ſo much as one ſingle<pb n="183" facs="tcp:168371:92"/>ſoule from eternall death. But he is God, as well as man, and therefore able to juſtifie, ſanctifie, and glorifie even millions of worlds. <hi>With thee</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> unto God) <hi>is the fountaine of life, Pſalm.</hi> 36.9. A fountatine that can never be exhauſted. The fulneſſe of the Godhead in Chriſt is not as a river, but as a ſea, whence flow all thoſe ſtreames that <hi>make glad the city of God, Pſalm.</hi> 46.4. It was from his Deity that there was in him an ample ſufficiency, <hi>to finiſh the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make an end of ſinnes, and to make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſſe, Dan.</hi> 9.24. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his righteouſneſſe is the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. therefore it is appliable to, and available for all the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that ever were, are, or ſhall be in the world. Becauſe it was the <hi>great God, that was our Saviour, and gave himſelfe for us; Therefore he hath redeemed us from all iniquity, and purified us unto himſelfe a peculiar people, Tit.</hi>
2.13,14. Becauſe he is the Sonne of God, therefore his bloud cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. therefore by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath by eternall generation, given unto the Sonne to have life in himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. therefore he quickeneth whom he will,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 21. He can quicken thoſe ſoules, that are dead in ſinns, and treſpaſſes; and he will at the laſt day quicken thoſe bodies, that have for thouſands of yeares beene rotten in their graves. Becauſe he is the <hi>Lord from heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. therefore he can clothe our <hi>mortall,</hi> and <hi>corruptible bodies with incorruption and immortality;</hi> He <hi>can change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according unto the working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe, Phil.</hi> 3.21. Can you deſire more comfort, then that, which this point yeeldeth: It promiſeth as much perfection, as our natures can hold.</p>
            <p>But it is indeed onely unto thoſe, who are qualified; as thoſe
<hi>Coloſſians</hi> were, unto whom our Apoſtle directs this
<hi>Epiſtle; Saints,</hi> and <hi>faithfull Brethren, Chapt.</hi> 1.2.
<hi>who have received Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord, rooted, and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, abounding therein with thankſgiving,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168371:93"/>Chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>This reſtriction</hi> is implied (thinke <hi>ſome</hi>) in that the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not ſay, ye are compleate <hi>from him,</hi> or
<hi>by him,</hi> but ye are compleat <hi>in him.</hi> That clauſe,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in him, containeth (ſay they) a deſcription of thoſe, that are thus compleate. They are ſuch, as are in Chriſt, as have an actuall inexiſtence in him; Such as are incorporated, and implanted into him by the ſpirit, and faith: And they are all new creatures, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. they have all the ſpirit of Chriſt,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. Men may take a full draught of a

               </note> naturall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and yet not goe into it, but ſtand without it. But now as for this ſpirituall fountaine, Chriſt Jeſus, none can ſo much as ſippe of the water of life in him, without paſſing into him, by the act of a faith, that <hi>purifyeth the heart, Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>and worketh by love, Galat.</hi> 5.6. and out of the belly of him, that believeth, ſhall flow rivers of living water, John 7.38. Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſeparate from the vine, wither, and grow ſapleſſe: Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, cut off from the head, are dead, and become carrion. Profeſſours, diſunited from Chriſt, can have no vitall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, no participation of any true, and reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe from him. They are but liveleſſe pictures of Chriſtians, have onely a
<hi>forme of Godlineſſe,</hi> onely the carcaſſe of that perfection, which Chriſt imparteth unto his members; and therefore, however they may be for their naturall, and acquired endowments, moſt accompliſhed perſons, yet as touching ſpirituals, they are next to divels, of all creatures moſt imperfect, and incompleate, <hi>wretched, and miſerable, poore, blind, and naked, Revel.</hi> 3.17. <hi>able to doe nothing, John.</hi> 15.5.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place; <hi>Paul</hi> inferreth from the
<hi>perſonall union,</hi> the <hi>dignity of the humane nature of Chriſt,</hi> in compariſon of the good Angels. Becauſe <hi>in him dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Godhead,</hi> therefore, <hi>he is the head of all principality and power.</hi> Here examine we 1. what is meant by principality, and power, 2. How Chriſt, as man, is the head of all principality, and power.</p>
            <p>1. Then enquire we, what is meant by <hi>principality,</hi> and
<hi>power.</hi> In <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. of this chapter, and in
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. they ſignify evill Angels. But here they are taken onely for the<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168371:93"/>
               <hi>good Angels. Angels,</hi> which are tearmed in ſcripture, the <hi>elect Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.21. the
<hi>Angels of heaven, Math.</hi> 24.36. the <hi>Angells of light,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. the <hi>ſonnes of God, Job.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Job.</hi>
38.7. who are tearmed 1. <hi>Principalities,</hi> from that excellency, which they have by nature, and grace, above other creatures: they are the chiefe of the creation, as it were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in compariſon of other creatures.</p>
            <p>2. They are ſtiled <hi>powers,</hi> for that Authority, which God hath delegated unto them, over other creatures.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>reſtriction</hi> of the tearmes here unto the
<hi>good Angels,</hi> I ſhall alleadge 3 <hi>arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This headſhip is a ſequele of the perſonall union, and therefore no meere creature ſhareth in it. But if it denoted barely a ſuperiority over the <hi>wicked Angels,</hi> it were a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge communicable unto the <hi>good Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To be <hi>head</hi> is properly a ſuperiority, that is ſome way or other beneficiall unto thoſe, unto whom it relates. And therefore Chriſt intended good unto thoſe <hi>principalities,</hi> and
<hi>powers,</hi> unto whom he is an <hi>head.</hi> But he deſigned no good unto the <hi>wicked Angels;</hi> and therefore, they are not here meant.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> here, are in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the Angels, the worſhip of whom is prohibited,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 18. And they are <hi>good Angels:</hi> For unlikely, that the ſeducers, againſt whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> dealeth, ſhould preſſe them unto the worſhip of <hi>wicked Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having found what is meant by theſe <hi>principalities,</hi> and
<hi>powers,</hi> enquire we <hi>next,</hi> how <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as
<hi>man,</hi> is an <hi>head</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Why, 1. in regard of <hi>excellency</hi> above them. 2. in regard of <hi>authority</hi> over them. And 3. (As ſome thinke) in reſpect <hi>of influence</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>1. Then, becauſe in the manhood of Chriſt there dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all-fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, therefore, as <hi>man,</hi> he is an
<hi>head</hi> unto the <hi>good Angels,</hi> in regard of <hi>excellency,</hi> or <hi>eminency above them.</hi> He is ſuperiour to them, becauſe all Angelicall perfections whatſoever, fall farre ſhort of the
<hi>hypoſtaticall</hi> union, which is denyed unto the Angels, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:168371:94"/>vouchſafed unto the humane nature, in the perſon of Chriſt. <hi>He tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but he tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Being made ſo much better then the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name then they, Heb.</hi> 1.4. Though they be <hi>Principalities,</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> excellent, glorious, and powerfull creatures, yet they are ſtill but
<hi>meere creatures.</hi> But now Chriſt, as <hi>man,</hi> hath by the
<hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall union,</hi> obtained a more excellent name, then they; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby, as <hi>man,</hi> he is <hi>perſonally</hi> the ſonne of God,

            <p>2. Becauſe in Chriſt, <hi>man,</hi> dwelleth
<hi>all-fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily,</hi> therefore he is an
<hi>head</hi> of the <hi>good Angels,</hi> in regard of <hi>authority over them;</hi> they are his ſervants, his <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, Heb.</hi>

<hi>pag.</hi> 261; and others have ſaid againſt the <hi>meritorious influence</hi> of Chriſt, as <hi>man,</hi> upon the grace, and
<hi>eſſentiall</hi> glory of <hi>Angels,</hi> who yet grant in his humanity an <hi>influence</hi> of <hi>illumination, Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. and
<hi>accidentall joy, Luk.</hi> 15.7,9. upon them.</p>
            <p>We may from them take theſe <hi>two arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To ſay, that the Angels confirmation in their gracious and glorious eſtate, &amp; the preſervation of them from falling, doth preſuppoſe the fall of Adam, is a proofeleſſe aſſertion: But the mediation of Chriſt preſuppoſeth the fall of Adam, as being occaſioned thereby. And for any one to affirme, that Chriſt had been mediatour, and had been incarnate, if Adam had never falne, is to ſpeake without evidence from ſcripture; therefore Chriſt's mediation for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſervation of Angels, is an unſcripturall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt merited for thoſe, unto whom he was a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. But now Chriſt did not merit any thing for Angels: therefore he was not a mediatour for them. The <hi>minor,</hi> which onely will be queſtioned, may be thus proved: Chriſt died for all thoſe, unto whom he merited any thing: becauſe his merits had their conſummation at his death.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>36.</note> But now the ſcripture ſpeakes not one word, or ſyllable of Chriſt's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Angels; and therefore we may conclude, it is alſo ſilent, as touching his meriting any thing for them. And therefore, I ſhall for my part content my ſelſe with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof.</p>
            <p>Indeed the two former particulars of Chriſt's <hi>headſhip over</hi> the Angels, <hi>ſuperiority</hi> above them, and government of them is ſufficient for the comfort of the Church. It is a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto the Church, that the good Angels in heaven, are in point of Dignity inferiour unto her husband; but that they are under his authority, ſubject unto his government, makes much for her reall benefit, and ſecurity. For how can ſhe be unſafe, who is married unto the <hi>Lord Generall</hi> of the
<hi>Militia</hi> of heaven? All the Angels in heaven are the ſubjects of Chriſt, <hi>man,</hi> fully conformable unto his commands; and therefore will be very ready to doe any poſſible ſervice unto<pb n="188" facs="tcp:168371:95"/>the
<hi>Queene</hi> of their King. They will be very forward to miniſter, in all things requiſite, unto all heires of ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>to encampe round about them, Pſalm.</hi> 34.7. It is part of their charge, given unto them by Chriſt, to keepe his members in all their wayes, to beare them up in their hands, <hi>leaſt they daſh their foot againſt a ſtone, Pſalm.</hi> 91.11,12. Though the Church be begirt with never ſo many, and powerfull adverſaries, yet ſhe ſhould ſhake off all carnall feare of them: Becauſe her Saviour can (when he will) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what multitudes pleaſe him, of the heavenly hoſt, for her guard and protection. The combinations, and attempts of all the principalities and powers, in earth and hell, for her ruine, cannot but be vaine, and fruitleſſe, as long as her head is <hi>head</hi> of all the principalities and powers in heaven; for againſt theſe, the other can make no reſiſtance. This
<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidenteſhip</hi> of Chriſt over the Angels, was ſhewed in a viſion unto the prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> for the incouragement of the Jewes, againſt their abject ſtate under the <hi>Perſian</hi> empire.
<hi>I ſaw by night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horſe, and he ſtood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind were there red horſes, ſpeckled, and white. Then ſaid I, O my Lord, what are theſe? And the Angell, that talked with me, ſaid unto me, I will ſhew thee what theſe be: And the man, that ſtood among the myrtle trees, anſwered, and ſaid, Theſe are they, whom the Lord hath ſent to walke to and fro through the earth, Zech.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. Here we have the then low, and depreſſed condition of the Church, ſet forth by diverſe particulars: It was <hi>night</hi> with her, a darke and ſad time: ſhe was in a <hi>valley</hi> or <hi>bottome:</hi> And this bottome was covered with the ſhadow of black and thick trees: It was in the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome among the myrtle trees.</hi> But now the King, and protector of the Church is ready for her ſuccour, and reliefe. And therefore, he is ſaid to <hi>be riding:</hi> And he is like a conſuming fire, all in a flame with anger againſt her enemies; and therefore he is ſaid to ride on a <hi>red horſe.</hi> He is wayted and attended on by Angels, whom he employeth in his errands: <hi>They walke to and fro through the earth, verſ.</hi> 10. And they give up their account unto<pb n="189" facs="tcp:168371:95"/>him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.
<hi>Behind him were there red horſes ſpeckled, and white.</hi> They were
<hi>behind him,</hi> as ſouldiers following their captaine, and there were ſome for all diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<note place="margin">Junius.</note> 
               <hi>Red horſes, ad praeſtanda judicia,</hi> for execution of his judgments: <hi>White horſes, ad beneficia ejus praeſtanda,</hi> for conveyance of his benefits: And <hi>ſpeckled horſes, ad utrunque conjunctim,</hi> for actions of a mixt nature, partly for protection of his Church, and partly for puniſhment of her adverſaries. Chriſts ſoveraignety over the Angels, is (you ſee) a very comfortable doctrine unto the people of Chriſt: As it is uſefull for their
<hi>conſolation,</hi> ſo farther, it may ſerve for <hi>dehortation</hi> of them from the adoration, and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels, which perhaps the Apoſtle particularly aymed at againſt the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and other ſeducers, that urged the worſhip of <hi>Angels, verſ.</hi> 18. Suppoſe they be moſt excellent, and powerfull creatures, <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> yet they are ſtill the ſubjects, and ſervants of Chriſt, our mediatour. He ſtill is their head, and ſoveraigne, and therefore it were a very fooliſh part to forſake him, and flie unto their mediation. I ſhall conclude all, that I have to ſay on theſe words, with that of <hi>Calvin in locum. Sed interim tenendum eſt, ſurſum &amp; deorſum cancellos nobis circundari, ne à Chriſto vel tantillum divertat fides noſtra.</hi> This one thing muſt be kept in remembrance, that the Apoſtle here ſets us limits up-wards, and down wards: Upwards, towards the Angels, <hi>Principalities, and powers:</hi> And down-wards, towards <hi>philoſophy, and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men, and after the rudiments of the world:</hi> that ſo our faith may not ſwerve a jot from our head, and redeemer, Chriſt Jeſus, in whom <hi>dwelleth all fulneſſe of the Codhead bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Chriſt, as <hi>man,</hi> Secondly, there was a
<hi>fulneſſe of grace. There was in Chriſt</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Pererius</hi> upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>a threefold fulneſſe of grace. For there was in him habituall grace, the grace of headſhip, and the grace of union, and</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:168371:96"/>
               <hi>in all theſe three, he had a fulneſſe.</hi> 1. <hi>The habit uall grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with the ſoule of Chriſt, was moſt full, becauſe it was in the higheſt degree, and in the higheſt manner, and in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt excellency, wherein it could be had, ſecundum rationem gratiae, and according unto the end, whereunto grace was ordained, which is the union of an intellectuall nature with God. He was full of grace, having every vertue, grace gift, operation, &amp; effect of grace.</hi> 2. <hi>The grace of headſhip was moſt full in Chriſt, as reaching unto all the elect, not onely men, but angels alſo.</hi> 3. <hi>The grace of union was in him not onely full, but</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">He meaneth <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively,</hi> as it is terminated unto an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For <hi>formally</hi> in it felfe, the union is finite.</note> 
               <hi>infinite: Becauſe the union was made in the perſon of the word, which was of infinite perfection, and vertue. He nameth alſo another cauſe, for which this grace of union may be ſaid to be moſt full: Becauſe the word hath aſſumed into the unity of it's perſon, not onely the ſoule of man, but alſo his body, and all the parts thereof; All things whatſoever, that appertaine unto either the verity, or integrity, of the humane nature: Neither is this union of them with it, for a certaine determinate time, but for perpetuity; ſo that they never are to be ſeparated therefrom: Thus Pererius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the fuller opening of this branch of Chriſts fulneſſe, I ſhall handle theſe two following particulars: <hi>Chriſt</hi> as
<hi>man</hi> was 1. the <hi>object.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>ſubject</hi> of a
<hi>fulneſſe of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He was the <hi>object</hi> of a fulneſſe of grace, taking
<hi>grace,</hi> for the love, and favour of God. And to ſhew this,
<hi>Solomon</hi> a type of Chriſt, was by the command of the Lord himſelfe, tearmed <hi>Jedidiah:</hi>

               </note> that is, beloved of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. He is tearmed

               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>,
<hi>the Beloved:</hi> Becauſe he is beloved above all others; and none are beloved, but in, and for him: Becauſe it is he, whom the father loveth, and hath loved from everlaſting, not for any other, but for himſelfe, as being his naturall ſonne, in whom there is a perfect reſemblance of him. Agreeable unto this, is that, which Chriſt under the name of
<hi>wiſdome,</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Then was I by him, as one brought up with him: and I was dayly his delight &amp;c. Two things</hi> are here remarkable unto our preſent purpoſe, 1. in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> 'tis in the plurall number,
<note n="*" place="margin">The new Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:</note>
               <hi>delights,</hi> to ſignify that he was his greateſt delight. And 2. we have the <hi>connexion</hi> of this delight <pb n="191" facs="tcp:168371:96"/>of the father in the ſonne, and that on both the <hi>fathers,</hi> and the <hi>ſonnes part.</hi> 1. It is <hi>connexed</hi> on the fathers part, with his creation of all things: <hi>Then was I dayly his delight:</hi> that is, <hi>when he prepared the heavens, when he ſet a compaſſe upon the face of the depth: when be eſtabliſhed the clouds above: when he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fountaines of the deepe: when he gave to the ſea his decree, that the waters ſhould not paſſe his commandement: When he appointed the foundations of the earth, verſ.</hi> 27, 28, 29. And the reaſon of this connexion of the fathers complacency in the ſonne, with his creation of the heavens, the fountaines of the deepe, the ſea, the foundations of the earth, was, to intimate, that the father tooke more pleaſure in his ſonne, then in the view of all his creatures, then in all the glory, and beauty, that was in heaven, and in earth.
<hi>Next,</hi> we have the <hi>connexion</hi> of it on the ſonnes part, and that 1. <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> with his owne delight in the father: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing alwaies before him, verſ.</hi> 30. 2.
<hi>gratuitous, and voluntary,</hi> with his complacency in the ſonnes of men. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men, verſ.</hi> 31. The great and wonderfull inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt he hath in his father's love, is (as ſome conceive) ſet forth by that expreſſion in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. He <hi>is in the boſome of his father:</hi> that is, in his bowels, in his deareſt, and tendereſt affections. For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as
<hi>Pelargus</hi> upon the place obſerveth) the boſome is the place of love, and therefore, to be in the boſome of the father, is to be
<hi>dilectiſſimus,</hi> the moſt beloved of the father. Thus in common ſpeech, <hi>intimates</hi> are tearmed boſome friends, and <hi>Joh.</hi>
13.23. the <hi>diſciple, whom</hi> Jeſus loved, <hi>leaned on his boſome.</hi> For <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be in the <hi>boſome of Abraham, Luk.</hi> 15.16. was to have a moſt intimate, loving, and friendly fellowſhip, and communion with him, and all Believers in glory. The intimacy, that ought to be betwixt husband and wife, is expreſſed in Scripture by their being mutually in one another's boſomes: And therefore, the husband is tearmed the <hi>husband of the wifes boſome, Deut.</hi> 28.56. And the wife, the <hi>wife</hi> of her husbands boſome, <hi>Micah.</hi> 7.5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Saviour in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11,21,22. affirmeth, that <hi>he, and the father are one,</hi> that <hi>the father is in him: and he in the father,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168371:97"/>Cajetan,</hi> and others, expound this of that
<hi>oneneſſe of affection,</hi> which is between him, as <hi>man,</hi> and the Father. Indeed Chriſt as God is one with the father, in regard of the
<hi>divine eſſence,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> as he himſelfe affirmeth,
<hi>John.</hi> 10.30. But that he is to be conſidered here, as <hi>man, Cajetan</hi> proveth by this at <hi>leaſt probable argument.</hi> Chriſt is to be conſidered here, as praying; Now he prayeth as man, and not as God; And therefore he ſpeaketh of himſelfe, as incarnate. Chriſt man, and the father are one, by the indiſſoluble bond of mutuall love. They dwell in one another, by love; the father is in the ſonne, as a perſon that is loved, is in the partie loving: And The ſonne is in the father, as his beloved; as he, in whom he is well pleaſed. The fulneſſe of Chriſt's grace, or favour, with the father, is in part implied by that metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall expreſſion, of
<hi>Chriſt's ſitting at the right hand of God.</hi> For in wordly courts, this was the higheſt place, next to the King; and therefore a marke of ſpeciall, and extraordinary favour: and hereupon <hi>Solomon</hi> placed his
<hi>mother, and hu Queene, at his right hand,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19.
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.9. In <hi>John.</hi> 3.35. you may gather the eminency of the fathers love of the ſonne, from the vaſtneſſe of the Authority, that he hath committed unto him. <hi>The father loveth the ſonne, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe the father loveth the ſonne, therefore he hath given all things into his hand; therefore he hath ſubmitted the whole univerſe unto his diſpoſall, and government. Indeed, we may beſt take the meaſure of the love of God, towards Chriſt, from the <hi>fruits, and effects thereof,</hi> that great dignity, and Authority, thoſe great and glorious endowments, with which Chriſts humane nature was enriched.

                  <p>The ſecond is terminated to the manhood, and belongs to the grace of union, and this be tearmeth a perſonall gratiouſneſſe, and he deſcribeth it to be the free and ſpontaneous love of God, by which he imparted unto the humanity the perſonall being of the word, and therefore infinitely beloved of God.

And was not the publication hereof, at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, a publicke glorifying of him? Well, this affection of his Father he deriveth unto all believers: for 'tis for his ſake that his Father ſetteth his heart upon them. <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them:</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Maldonate,</hi> as thou haſt loved mee, ſo have I loved them. If God accept of him, he will not refuſe any that belong unto him. It is noted by ſome concerning
<hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. that the prepoſition, <hi>in,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>with,</hi> or <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>through</hi> whom; for it ſignifies, not onely that God is well-pleaſed with Chriſt, but alſo that he is well-pleaſed with others for his ſake: And who ſhould <hi>thoſe others be,</hi> but ſuch, in whoſe hearts he dwelleth by faith; for they are, as it were, parts of his fulneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. God's complacencie in his Sonne exempts them alone, of all the ſonnes of men, from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: and if God be well pleaſed with them, it matters not who is diſpleaſed. If they have his favour; they need not feare any mans frowne. His grace and love is an impregnable bulwarke againſt the hatred of all the world.</p>
            <p>But to breake the conſolation that this point affords unto the members of Chriſt into ſome particulars, They may hence inferre, that here in this life they ſhall enjoy <hi>a full remiſſion of their ſins, a gracious acceptation of their perſons, a plentifull proviſion for their wants, an aſſured and continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation<pb n="198" facs="tcp:168371:100"/>of their graces;</hi> and then (for the life to come) they may hence undoubtedly expect the full, and perfect <hi>glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their <hi>ſoules</hi> and bodies.</p>
            <p>1. They may conclude <hi>the full remiſſion</hi> of their ſins from the fulneſſe of Chriſts grace, and favour with God. If
<hi>any man ſinne we have an advocate with the father,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
2.1. an advocate, that is in the boſome of the father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. that hath his eare, and heart. And ſuch an advocate muſt needes prevaile.
<hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> a barbarous King, could not withſtand the petition of
<hi>his Queene,</hi> for the life of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. And can God (thinke you) deny the interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of his beloved ſonne, for the life, and pardon of <hi>his Queene,</hi> his Church, and people. <hi>We have an advocate with the father.</hi> The judge, whoſe favour and mercy in our behalfe he, as <hi>man,</hi> imploreth, is <hi>his father,</hi> and <hi>our father</hi> in him: And a father cannot be inexorable unto a ſonne, pleading for his brethren. We indeed are guilty, but he is innocent. <hi>We have an advocate with the father Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous.</hi> He is righteous, and therefore needs no remiſſion for himſelfe; And ſo might the better, and more boldly, ſpeake for us, if his interceſſion were onely out of
<hi>Charity.</hi> But his interceſſion is out of juſtice, and in a way of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for what he hath merited; and therefore cannot have a repulſe. He is ſuch an advocate, as is alſo a <hi>propitiation, verſ.</hi> 2. that is, a propitiatory ſacrifice for our ſinnes. He hath fully ſatisfied Gods juſtice for all the ſinnes of all his people; And therefore, he may juſtly challenge the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them. <hi>Beza</hi> and
<hi>Maldonate</hi> thinke, that in thoſe words, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. and
17.5. <hi>In whom I am well-pleaſed, the father ſignifieth, that Chriſt alone is the mediatour, and peacemaker, between God and man. When he looketh upon him, he layeth aſide all indignation, and is fully appeaſed, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> This may comfort againſt the inceſſant accuſations of Satan: He <hi>accuſeth</hi> the <hi>brethren before our God, day and night,</hi> for their ſins, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.10. But the interceſſion of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved will ſilence all his accuſations. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had read over a long letter, which <hi>Antipater</hi> had written unto him, againſt his mother <hi>Olympias:</hi> Loe (ſaith he)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:168371:100"/>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> knoweth not, that one teare of a mothers eye will wipe out ten-thouſand ſuch letters. Chriſt's interceſſion now in heaven is not, as it was <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh,</hi> with <hi>cryes, and teares, Heb.</hi> 5.7. but in an
<hi>authoritative way,</hi> in the right, and vertue of his ſacrifice, his death, the bloud of ſprinkling, <hi>which ſpeaketh better things, then the bloud of Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.24. And the ſacrifice, the bloud, the death of the ſonne of Gods love, is ſufficient to blot out all the criminations, that the accuſer of the Brethren puts up againſt them.</p>
            <p>2. They may hence inferre the <hi>gracious acceptation</hi> of their perſons with God. Of his fulneſſe have all we <hi>received,</hi> and that <hi>grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. that is, (as <hi>Pelargus</hi> out of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> expounds that clauſe) <hi>we are gracious, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with the Father, for that grace, wherewith he loveth, and accepteth the Son, made under the Law for us.</hi> Hereupon is it alſo, that
<hi>Pareus</hi> ſuppoſeth, that thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle, Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>in his grace he hath made us accepted in the beloved,</hi> are a <hi>commentary</hi> of this part of the Fathers voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>In whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> And hence alſo <hi>Beza</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thoſe words of the father with <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi>
36, 38. <hi>where the high Prieſt is commanded to appeare before the Lord, with a plate of pure gold upon his forehead, upon which was to be engraven, Holineſſe unto the Lord, that the people of Iſrael might be accepted before the Lord.</hi> For herein the high prieſt was a type of our great high Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus, in whoſe face, and for whoſe ſufferings and mediation, God accepted the perſon, and ſervices of his people: And this acceptation of them by God ſhould worke their hearts unto an holy and humble diſdaine of all the ſcorne and contempt of the world. If God accept, and embrace them, for the ſake of his beloved, what need they care, though all the enemies of him, and his beloved, deſpiſe them, and ſhunne all converſation with them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>From the dearneſſe</hi> of Chriſt unto God, compared with Gods expoſall of him unto death for his members, they may conclude, that God will make plentifull <hi>proviſion</hi> for all their wants. It is the inference of the Apoſtle himſelfe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his owne ſonne, but delivered him <pb n="200" facs="tcp:168371:101"/>up for us all: how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things.</hi> He that ſoared not his owne ſonne, his deare ſon, his moſt tenderly beloved ſonne; but delivered him up for us all unto the ſlaughter, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things: that is, all things needfull for our eternall happineſſe, and ſalvation: <hi>all things, that pertaine to life and godlineſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The promiſes of the life</hi> that now is, and <hi>of that which is to come,</hi> 1
<hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p>4. They may hence be certaine of a continuall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their graces,</hi> and preſervation from Apoſtacy. Gods

17.23. If the head be alwaies the <hi>beloved,</hi> the members can never be hated. The fruits therefore of this love, the <hi>gifts and callings of God are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11.29. If the <hi>naturall ſonne of</hi> God be daily his delight, and that as well unto, as from eternity: Therefore <hi>with everlaſting kindneſſe he will have mercy on</hi> his adoptive ſonnes.

54.8,10.</p>
            <p>But now if he ſhould not uphold, and eſtabliſh them by his ſpirit, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.12. if he ſhould not continually ſupport, and underprop their graces, but ſuffer them <hi>totally, and finally</hi> to decay and wither, this would be a palpable withdrawing of his loving kindneſſe, and a ſhutting up his tender mercies in anger. Beſides, the ſonnes love of them reſembleth the fathers love of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9.
<hi>As the father hath loved me, ſo have have I loved you.</hi> Now there is no change in the fathers love of him, therefore neither in his love of them: And therefore we may conclude, that as it is their <hi>duty,</hi> ſo it ſhall be their <hi>priviledge,</hi> and happineſſe, to continue in his love. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, in the behalfe of all believers, that nothing can divorce them from the love of God, in Chriſt,
<hi>that is, for Chriſt. I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from<pb n="201" facs="tcp:168371:101"/>the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, Rom.</hi> 8.38,39. In thoſe laſt words, <hi>which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> The Apoſtle layeth downe the ground of the perpetuity of God's love of his children. 'Tis not in themſelves, but in Chriſt Jeſus: that is, it is for his ſake, for that unalterable affection, which he beareth unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> from the <hi>eminency</hi> of God's favour unto Chriſt, his members may with confidence expect the perfect, and full glorification of their ſoules and bodies hereafter in heaven. For our Saviour himſelfe, in that prayer of his <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving petitioned for the glory of all that were to believe on him, he inforceth this his petition, by repreſenting unto the Father the love, that he hath borne unto him as
<hi>man</hi> from all eternity. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo, whom thou haſt given me, be with mee where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given mee: for thou lovedſt me before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, ver.</hi> 24. Is is as if he had ſaid: That love which thou beareſt unto me, expreſſe unto thoſe that are mine. As thou loved'ſt mee, inveſt them with that glory, which thou haſt decreed unto my humanity. Believers then may as confidently expect their owne glory, as they are aſſured of the Fathers affection unto Chriſt: and this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhould digeſt all their ſorrowes, and miſeries, here in this life.</p>
            <p>From Conſolations I proceed unto Exhortations, and they ſhall be directed, either unto the <hi>enemies,</hi> or <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. Then for <hi>enemies,</hi> and <hi>aliens;</hi> they may hence be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1. Unto <hi>humiliation</hi> for their paſt enmity againſt Chriſt. 2. Unto a <hi>ſerious and earneſt endeavour</hi> after reconciliation, and union with him.</p>
            <p>1. Unto <hi>humiliation</hi> for their paſt enmity againſt
<hi>him, and his,</hi> his members, miniſters, and other ordinances. Who dare almoſt oppoſe the Minions of earthly Princes: for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory preſents us with plentifull inſtances of ſuch, whom their very frownes have ruined. O then the hatred of heavens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite muſt needs be infinitely more fatall, and unfortunate, Becauſe he is able to cruſh his moſt potent adverſaries.<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168371:102"/>tremble then to conſider, that all thy life long thou haſt hated the <hi>beloved,</hi> loathed and abhorred God's darling, been averſe from the <hi>Son of his love:</hi> rejected <hi>his elect ſervant,</hi> in whom his ſoule delighteth, been a moſt diſaffected, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Antagoniſt unto him, in whom the Father is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe Chriſt is ſo highly graced with God, all his
<hi>enemies</hi> may be exhorted to doe, what lieth in them, for the future, for reconciliation and union with him, by application of themſelves unto the diligent uſe of ſuch meanes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as God hath ſanctified, and ſet apart for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For thoſe that are not united with him cannot expect ſo much as a good look from God, becauſe God is reconciled onely in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. he accepts none but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. He is well pleaſed with none, but ſuch as are in him. Thoſe that are out of him lye under the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and wrath of God, which is a conſuming fire. In terrene courts, how ambitious are men to be related unto the grand favourite, as knowing, that he is the channell of all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preferments. Should it not then be the utmoſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, to have relation unto Chriſt: for through him onely God diſpenſeth all ſaving favours unto the ſonnes of men. We may ſay of him, in reference unto God, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> did of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> the powerfull favourite of <hi>Tiberius: ut quiſ<expan>

But now in the Court of Heaven there is no middle betwixt the two extreams of intimacy and hatred. They are all either ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or intimates. Thoſe are under a cloud, that are not in<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168371:102"/>grace and favour. All they are rejected, that are not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beloved: And therefore in diſunion from Chriſt there is nothing to be expected but rejection, diſgrace, ſhame, everlaſting contempt, and confuſion.</p>
            <p>I paſſe on unto thoſe exhortations, that concerne the members of Chriſt, and they <hi>are ſeven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If we compare the tranſcendency of Gods love of Chriſt, with the greatneſſe of his ſufferings for their ſins, this will afford a ſtrong argument unto an <hi>hatred of,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> or
<hi>humiliation for</hi> ſinne: For nothing can more lively diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the hainouſneſſe of ſin, and the terrour of Gods wrath againſt it. Chriſt was an object of a fulneſſe of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and withall he was the object of a fulneſſe of wrath, as our ſins were charged upon him, as our ſurety: <hi>He was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our tranſgreſſions, &amp; bruiſed for our iniquities, Iſai</hi> 53.5. <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of my people was he ſtricken, ver.</hi> 8. <hi>He made his ſoule an offering for ſinne, ver.</hi> 10. God would never have uſed ſuch a rigour and extremity of ſeverity towards his deare Sonne, for
<hi>ſinne</hi> imputed to him, if <hi>ſinne</hi> had not beene a thing, which he infinitely abhorred. O what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is there in that, for which God was
<note n="u" place="margin">Irae autem hujus objectum fuit Chriſtus, non abſolute, ſed tantummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quoad pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, quae per iram infertur, quam ille tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſponſor noſter ſubivit. <hi>Ames</hi> med. Theol. lib. 1. c. 22. ſect. 9.</note> angry with the ſon of his love, for which (for a while) he deſerted him, in whom he was well pleaſed, which turned the favourable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a loving father, into frownes againſt a beloved ſonne.</p>
            <p>2. They may hence be <hi>exhorted</hi> unto a
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> in their <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt. If he be the beloved of God, it is fit that he ſhould be their beloved too, that they may ſay unto him, as the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. <hi>O thou whom our ſoule loveth.</hi> He is in the boſome of the Father; &amp; therefore he ſhould be no ſtranger unto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes. We ſhould alwaies lodge him in our hearts, thoughts, and affections. We ſhould not be cold and remiſſe in our love of the Sonne of Gods love. He ever was, is, and will be the delight of God, and therefore our complacency ſhould be in him, above all the creatures. God hath ſet his whole love upon him, and therefore we ſemblably ſhould ſet our whole hearts upon him alſo, and not divide them betwixt him and the creature, betwixt him and our corruptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:168371:103"/>3. The members of Chriſt may hence be provoked <hi>unto thank-fulneſſe,</hi> and that both unto <hi>the father,</hi> and unto <hi>Chriſt himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Unto the father, and that in regard of two
<hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe his love of him is the <hi>Originall</hi> of his love of us. 2. The giving of a perſon, ſo highly beloved, unto the death for us, is <hi>a moſt evident demonſtration</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurableneſſe of his affection unto us.</p>
            <p>1. Then let us glorify him for the fulneſſe of his love unto Chriſt, as man, and mediatour, becauſe it is the <hi>Originall</hi> of all the love, that he bareth unto his Children, if we ſpeake of Gods love
<hi>quoad effectum:</hi> that is, it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all the good decreed unto them. Chriſt's election is the cauſe of our election, <hi>non quoad actum eligentis,</hi> not of the act of election: for that being in God, is the ſame with God himſelfe, and therefore independant, and without a cauſe; but <hi>quoad res electione praeparatas,</hi> as touching the grace and glory, unto which we are by election deſigned. All the fruits, and effects of our election, are derived unto us from Chriſt's election. And if Chriſt, as
<hi>man,</hi> had not been elected unto the grace of perſonall union, a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of habituall grace, and perfection of glory, we had been for ever rejected from the preſence, and favour of God. If he had not beene the ſonne of Gods love, we had all of us been for ever Children of wrath, and ſonnes of perdition; and therefore is it, that <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> in his teſtimony of Chriſt, aſcribes unto him the comming of grace or favour unto men. The law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>grace, &amp;c. came by Jeſus Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 1.17. If Jeſus Chriſt had not come in the fleſh, the grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation, had never appeared unto the ſonnes of men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. but they had all of them for ever layne under the curſe, and condemnation of the Law. In that
<hi>benediction</hi> of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. grace is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated unto Chriſt, and that not onely as God, but alſo as man,
<hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He was in himſelfe <hi>the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall object</hi> of Gods grace and favour: &amp; he was the
<hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of it's <hi>derivation</hi> unto us: He purchaſed, and procured<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168371:103"/>all the grace and favour we enjoy with God. Hence alſo is it, that the Angels in their doxologie averre, that the good will of God accrewed unto men by Chriſt incarnate,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. After the fall, all the expreſſions of Gods good will unto mankind were for the merits of his beloved: In him alone he was well pleaſed. Our Saviour himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. prayeth for the glorification of believers, upon the account of his Fathers love of him.
<hi>Father, I will that they alſo, whom thou haſt given mee, be with mee where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my glory, which thou haſt given mee: for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi> This ſufficiently intimates, that they owe all their glory unto Gods love of Chriſt, as man, and mediatour: for otherwiſe there were little congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in bringing
<hi>this,</hi> as an argument to back his prayer for <hi>that.</hi> If God then had not loved Chriſt before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, lapſed man could never have been glorified, never have ſeen the face of God in heaven. <hi>God hath bleſſed us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.3. that is, for Chriſt's ſake. All the ſweet and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell are as ſo many beames of Gods love; and that they ſhine upon us, it is onely by reflection from this Sun of righteouſneſſe. If the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had not ſhined upon him, we had ſtill ſate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. Not ſo much as one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpell had ever ſhone upon our poore ſoules: for all the promiſes of God in him are <hi>yea,</hi> and in him <hi>Amen:</hi> that is, they are all made, and performed for him, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>dearneſſe</hi> of Chriſt unto the Father, compared with the Fathers expoſall of him unto death for us, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the matchleſſe eminency of the Fathers love unto us, and ſo is a very preſſing argument for our thankſgiving: See what our Saviour himſelfe ſpeakes in exaltation, and as it were admiration of this love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> The particle <hi>(ſo)</hi> points out ſuch an height of love, as is unexpreſſible: Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacke all the
<hi>Poëts,</hi> and in all their fictions you can find no paralell unto this love: That he ſhould ſeeme for a<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168371:104"/>time, to ſuſpend his love unto <hi>his beloved,</hi> that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his love unto enemies, unto traytors, and rebels; that he ſhould deliver up the ſonne of his love unto the utmoſt ſeverity, and rigour of the law, for the ranſome of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath;</hi> that he ſhould not ſpare him, for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that he might ſpare them: that hee ſhould make him a curſe, to redeeme them from the curſe of the law, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. that hee ſhould ſcourge him, to heale them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5. puniſh him, to ſave them: give him up unto death, that they might enjoy eternall life: that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him, in <hi>point of conſolation,</hi> that they might not be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, but embraced in the armes of his love for ever. O this ſpeaketh the moſt tranſcendent love, that ever God ſhewed towards any miſerable creature. And therefore the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged thankes, and praiſes, will fall infinitely ſhort of it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>next</hi> place, if we conſider the connexion of this
<hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods love</hi> unto Chriſt, with Chriſt's
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, we ſhall find very great reaſon for the <hi>direction</hi> of our thankes, and praiſes unto Chriſt himſelfe, as well as unto the Father. We have theſe <hi>two fulneſſes of love</hi> connexed by Chriſt, under the name of wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30,31.
<hi>Though he was by God, as one brought up with him: and was daily his delight, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the habitable part of his earth: and his delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Which paſſage we may expound by thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you.</hi> O what an aſtoniſhable condeſcention is there in this love of our Saviour, that the darling, and onely beloved of the great God of glorious heaven, ſhould fetch a ſpouſe from this miſerable earth, ſhould caſt his eye, and ſet his heart upon ſuch forlorne creatures, and depraved ſinners, as we are; that he, which is in the boſome of the Father, ſhould take ſuch deſpicable wretches, as we are, into his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, marry us unto himſelfe, and rejoyce over us, as a <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome rejoyceth over his bride, Iſai.</hi> 62.5. Such was the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, in the fruition of his Fathers eternall love, as that it was uncapable of any further improvement. But yet notwithſtanding this his happy ſtate and condition, he ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo low as to make his rebellious ſervants the objects of<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168371:104"/>a boundleſſe affection. Was not this, as it were, a debaſing of himſelfe; and ſuch a mercy unto us, as is above recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence? All that we can do, is humbly and thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, admire, and adore it; to reſigne up our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of him, and unto ſuffering for him (if he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us with a call thereunto,) and to make it the chiefeſt matter of our care, to decline whatſoever is unſuitable unto this high place of grace and favour with him, and will reflect any diſhonour, or reproach thereon.</p>
            <p>4. The height of Chriſts grace and favour with God ſhould prevaile with us for <hi>obedience</hi> unto his doctrine, and
<hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> unto his directions. This uſe was made of it by Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30,32, &amp;c. <hi>I was dayly his delight. Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Children: for bleſſed are they that keepe my wayes, verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>Heare inſtruction, and be wiſe, and refuſe it not.</hi> It is alſo preſſed by his father, in his transfiguration, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well-pleaſed: Heare ye him:</hi> that is, in the language of ſcripture, obey him, accept him, not onely as <hi>a prieſt,</hi> to ſatisfy for you; as a <hi>redeemer,</hi> to ſave you; but alſo as a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> to inſtruct you; as a <hi>King,</hi> and ſoveraigne Lord, to governe, and guide you. The onely begotten ſonne is alone in the <hi>boſome of the father,</hi> and therefore beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his mind and will, and conſequently beſt qualified, and enabled for the revelation thereof. He onely can declare him: for no man beſides him hath ſeen God at any time,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. Unto him therefore in his word let us onely have recourſe, for inſtruction in things towards God: And unto ſuch inſtructions let us lend an open eare, and heart, let us yield a ready and full conformity, without farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with fleſh and bloud.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe Chriſt is in ſuch great grace and favour with God, it will be diſcretion to have all our addreſſes unto, and worſhip of God in his name, through his mediation. He is the powerfull favourite of heaven, and therefore all acceſſes unto the God of Heaven are by him, all diſpatches from heaven unto earth paſſe through him, not a promiſe, not a ſaving mercy, not a word of peace and comfort is <pb n="208" facs="tcp:168371:105"/>conveyed unto a believing ſoule but through his mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The greateſt part of publicke ceremoniall worſhip under the law was lawfull, and acceptable unto God, onely at the Temple in Jeruſalem. Sacrifices were to be offered onely upon the Altar there, <hi>Iſai.</hi>
20.4. <hi>and</hi> 56.7. The Temple and Altar were herein types of Chriſt, in whom alone the whole <hi>morall</hi> worſhip and ſervice of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, out of him God rejecteth, and looketh upon the moſt glorious performances, as heatheniſh abominations, as <hi>the butchery of a man, the cutting off a dogs neck, the offering ſwines bloud, the bleſſing of an Idol, Iſay.</hi> 66.3. It is in the beloved alone, that God accepteth of, and is well pleaſed with, as our perſons ſo our ſervices; all prayers preferred, all duties performed in his name will ſpeed well, and find a gracious, and favourable reception. It is related in <hi>Plutarch</hi> of
<hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles,</hi> that when he fled from the fury of his Citizens, unto
<hi>Admetus,</hi> King of the <hi>Moloſſians,</hi> whom yet he had formerly provoked, he tooke the Kings little <hi>young ſonne</hi> in his armes, and went and kneeled downe before the <hi>Altar</hi> in his <hi>chappel,</hi> which humble manner of ſueing the <hi>Molo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſians</hi> tooke to be moſt effectuall, and ſuch as was not to be refuſed. When being purſued by the guilt and cry of our ſinnes, the rigorous ſentence of the law, the accuſations of Sathan, and the terrours of our owne conſcience for them, we runne unto an incenſed God for mercy, there is no way to appeaſe him, but to take his deare ſonne in the armes of our faith, and to lodge, or offer him, as it were, upon the Altar of his boſome. This is ſuch an enforcing manner of ſupplication, as that God in his new covenant of grace hath engaged himſelfe unto a complyance with it.</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe Chriſt is ſo eminently gracious with God the father, we ſhould be ſtirred up unto a <hi>correſpondency</hi> with him in his affections, to love thoſe perſons and things, which he loveth, and to deteſt whatſoever he hateth. Courtiers uſually ſeeme at leaſt to proportion all their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions unto thoſe of the Princes minion. They admire whatſoever he liketh; they adore whomſoever he affecteth; and profeſſe a deepe diſlike of all that he diſaffecteth. They
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168371:105"/>affront and quarrell all upon whom he frowneth. Well then, may not we be aſhamed, that there is not the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in us with Gods favourite. We dote upon ſin, which his ſoule abhorreth. We delight in that company, and thoſe places, unto which he is a ſtranger. We loath thoſe ordinances, which have his moſt evident approbation, and inſtitution. Thoſe unſavoury and prophane jeſts, rotten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that are an abomination unto him, and ſtinke before him, are the matter of our greateſt merriment. We diſtaſt moſt the converſation of thoſe, that have moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate communion with him. Thoſe are an eye-ſore unto us, who are as tender unto him, as the Apple of his eye. His <hi>jewels, Mal.</hi> 3.17. his crowne jewels, his <hi>crowne of glory, and royall diademe, Iſay.</hi> 62. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. are accounted by us as the filth of the world, and offſcouring of all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that he eſteemeth more amiable in men, then the beauty of holineſſe, the Image of God. This is the <hi>chaine upon the neck of his ſpouſe, Cant.</hi> 4.9. that raviſheth his heart; And there is nothing more, that our hearts riſe againſt. O, what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing is this
<hi>antipathy</hi> unto him, that is in the <hi>boſome of the father,</hi> &amp; <hi>at his right hand.</hi> How unſafe is it to be thus oppoſite unto his affections; Hereby we muſt needs incurre the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both of him &amp; his father, and that is the undoubted path unto everlaſting ruine, and deſtruction; for in their <hi>favour is liſe, Pſalm.</hi> 30.5.</p>
            <p>7. And laſtly, If Chriſt be ſo great and gracious with God, It then very much concerneth us to labour for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love, and favour. For we muſt needs be liable unto perpetuall torment and terrour of mind, as long as we are in ſuſpenſe of our eternall condition; As long as we are doubtfull, whether we ſhall be for ever miſerable or happy. And the wrath of Chriſt, who is chiefe in the affection of the father, is (as
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the wrath of a King) <hi>as the meſſengers of death, and roaring of a lyon.</hi> Whereas on the other ſide, <hi>in the light of his countenance is life, and his favour is as a cloud of the latter raine, Prov.</hi> 16.14,15. <hi>and</hi> 19.12. <hi>and</hi> 20.2. If he ſmile upon a ſoule nothing can make it miſerable, and if he frowne upon it, nothing can make it happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:168371:106"/>For God is reconciled to none, but in and through him. He makes none bleſſed but for his ſake. Well then, we can expect no tranquility of ſpirit, no ſolid comfort, no ſound peace of conſcience, no <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we have attained a certaine and well bottomed perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the ſonne of Gods love, in whom alone he is well pleaſed, hath lifted up the light of his countenance upon us.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid touching our aſſurance of Chriſts love, may be applied unto our aſſurance of Gods love of us in and for Chriſt. For it is of no leſſe importance, as being inſeparably connexed therewith, and the ground and cauſe thereof; and therefore, without Gods love of us for Chriſt his ſake, we can never be happy, and without aſſurance of it, we can never be comfortable. Hereupon is it, that in the ſalutations prefixed unto moſt of <hi>Paul's</hi> epiſtles, peace is made a ſequele of grace from God our father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Without the grace of acceptation with the father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo ſenſe and apprehenſion thereof, no peace of conſcience, no ſerenity of ſpirit is to be expected. That man, that is doubtfull of Gods love in and for Chriſt, if his conſcience be awak'ned, cannot but have a perpetuall tempeſt in his boſome: For he can apprehend God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o otherwiſe then a conſuming fire; And ſuch a conſideration muſt needs beget unutterable horrour. Our Saviour himſelfe makes this aſſurance the ſcope of the revelation of Gods goodneſſe, and mercy, in the goſpell, <hi>John.</hi> 17.26. <hi>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them, and I in them.</hi> There be ſome that underſtand that clauſe, <hi>that the love, wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them,</hi> concerning the <hi>extenſion,</hi> or
<hi>termination</hi> of Gods love of Chriſt unto Believers, as a
<hi>ſecondary object;</hi> and they thus gloſſe the words: That thou may'ſt love them for my ſake; that thou may'ſt love them with that love, wherewith thou haſt loved me. Believers are made by faith one body with Chriſt, and therefore cannot but ſhare in Gods love of Chriſt. If God love him, They cannot but be<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168371:106"/>beloved in, and for him; and therefore our Saviour addes; <hi>and I in them: which is</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Maldonate</hi>) <hi>becauſe I am in them; to wit, as the head in the members.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid: <hi>ſeeing I am in them, ſeeing I dwell in their hearts by faith, ſo that I and they make but one body myſticall, therefore thy love of me cannot but be derived unto them.</hi> If thou loveſt me, it is impoſſible thou ſhould'ſt hate them. This <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of Gods love of Chriſt unto Believers is in regard of the <hi>fruites</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of it, &amp; ſo it is the ſame with it's <hi>preſence of influence</hi> on them. The body of the Sun is in the heavens, but the efficacy of it reacheth unto the loweſt of the elements, the earth, cauſing on its ſurface light, and warmth, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the very bowels of it many rich metalls, and minerals. Thus the love, wherewith God loveth Chriſt, is in God himſelfe, if we ſpeake of
<hi>a preſence of inherence,</hi> (taking the word <hi>largly,</hi> as it is applicable unto any <hi>adjuncts,</hi> even ſuch as the attributes of God are;) But it is in all them that believe in regard of <hi>a preſence of influence, and effective preſence:</hi> for it enlightneth, and comforteth them, and produceth in their boſomes the precious gifts, and graces of the ſpirit. But now the love, wherewith God loveth Chriſt, is ſaid to be in believers, not onely in regard of their <hi>participation,</hi> but alſo
<hi>perception</hi> of it, not onely <hi>effectively,</hi> in regard of its
<hi>effects,</hi> grace, and glory; but alſo <hi>objectively,</hi> in regard of an <hi>objective,</hi> or <hi>intentionall preſence,</hi> as it is the object of their knowledge, apprehenſion, and aſſurance. And they never fully and truly know and apprehend it, as they ought, but in the
<hi>rebound,</hi> and by way of <hi>reflection,</hi> untill they be aſſured of it's being terminated unto, and reflected upon them; untill as it is
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>the love of God be ſhed abroad in their hearts:</hi> untill they have a full ſence and feeling of that love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God loveth them in Chriſt: untill they have <hi>taſted that the Lord is good, and gracious unto them for Chriſt, Pſalm.</hi> 34.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. A practicall, and experimentall, full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then, and aſſurance of Gods love of Chriſt, implieth in the reſult, knowledge, and aſſurance of Gods love of us; ſo that they, who are doubtfull, and diſtruſtfull of Gods love of themſelves, fall ſhort in a due apprehenſion of Gods love
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:168371:107"/>of Chriſt. The reaſon for this coherence of theſe
<hi>two aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> is the connexion betwixt their objects, <hi>Gods love of Chriſt, and Gods love of us.</hi> For 1. If wee looke upon the
<hi>act</hi> of each, as conſidered in God, ſo they are one and the ſame decree of election. Gods election of Chriſt, and his members, are not different <hi>acts, à parte rei; &amp; à parte rationis,</hi> in our manner or way of conceiving, they are (as Dr <hi>Twiſſe</hi> often ſheweth) <hi>coordinate</hi> and <hi>ſimultaneous,</hi> as being parts of one <hi>formall compleat</hi> decree <hi>de mediis.</hi> 2. If we compare the
<hi>fruites</hi> of each love, ſo the fruits or effects of God's love of us, all the good we enjoy for the preſent, or expect for the future, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the effects of Gods love of Chriſt, the habituall grace of his humane nature, the ſatisfaction and merit of his obedience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This aſſurance and feeling, that believers have of Gods love of Chriſt, and of themſelves for Chriſt, is <hi>amplified</hi> here from the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and from a <hi>concomitant</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it, manifeſtation of the name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the <hi>arme of the Lord, Iſai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love, wherewith thou haſt loved mee, may be in them.</hi> By the <hi>name</hi> of God is meant the

               </note> 
               <hi>glory</hi> of God, even as the
<hi>name</hi> of men is taken for that credit, eſtimation, and regard, which they are in. There is a glory of God, which the very creatures declare,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. The glory of his power, wiſdome, and generall love, as he is the creatour, preſerver, &amp; governour of the world. But now the glory, which is the name of the Lord, of which Chriſt here is the revealer, is that of <hi>eſpeciall, ſaving and redeeming love and mercy,</hi> which ſhineth in the Goſpell, &amp; covenant of grace. The heavens and firmament declare not ſo much glory, as the croſſe of Chriſt. What glory of God can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable unto his <hi>ſo loving the world,</hi> that lieth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to give for it his only
<hi>begotten ſon, Joh.</hi> 3.16. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this glory doth moſt eminently merit to be intitled his <hi>name.</hi> Well, you ſee the knowledge &amp; ſence of Gods love of Chriſt, and of us in Chriſt, is the maine end and drift of Chriſts manifeſting this name, this glory of God by his word and Spirit. And therefore, we ſhould give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence<pb n="213" facs="tcp:168371:107"/>to make this love ſure, to have a due and deep taſte and feeling of it, to have it ſhed abroad in our hearts. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have not attained hitherto, they walke as yet below the revelation of Gods name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and arme in the Goſpell. But now the <hi>firſt manifeſtation of</hi> Gods name, at our firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, will not ſerve the turne. <hi>I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it, &amp;c.</hi> I have manifeſted it in their firſt illumination, and I will manifeſt it in the further growth and progreſſe of their knowledge. Hence then we may obſerve, that to raiſe believers unto ſuch an height, as the due aſſurance of this love, there will be continuall need of new, freſh, farther, and fuller diſcoveries or manifeſtations of Gods name in the Goſpell. And therefore, let the <hi>word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſedome, Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Watch daily at the gates of wiſdome; waiting at the poſts of her doores, Prov.</hi> 8.34. Narrowneſſe in the manifeſtations of Gods name is ever followed with weakneſſe, and feebleneſſe in our aſſurance of his love. They, to whom the arme of the Lord is revealed but in a ſmall meaſure, may preſume much, but they know but little of the love, wherewith God loveth Chriſt, and his members.</p>
            <p>2. We have this aſſurance of believers amplified from the
<hi>concomitant</hi> of it, <hi>growth in their union with Chriſt. That the love, wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi> The meaning of thoſe laſt words, <hi>and I in them,</hi> is, that I may dwell more and more in their hearts by faith. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our union with Chriſt is inſeparably connexed with our aſſurance of Gods love of us for Chriſt, as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect thereof; And this may ſerve both for
<hi>comfort and triall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Comfort:</hi> For what an unſpeakable Comfort and advantage doe believers reape by their aſſurance, in that it thus promoteth their union with Chriſt, by knowledge and aſſent, by love and adherence. It begets more cleareneſſe and evidence in their knowledge of, more certainty in their aſſent unto the promiſes of the Goſpell: It workes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their love of, and firmneſſe in their adherence unto Chriſt, and ſo every way, in every regard, it knits, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168371:108"/>unites more cloſely unto him: and increaſe of our union with him enlargeth our communion with him, in all the bleſſings flowing therefrom, and depending thereon.</p>
            <p>2. This may ſerve for <hi>tryall</hi> of the ſoundneſſe and ſincerity of believers aſſurance of Gods love: whereſoever it is, there is a progreſſe in their union with Chriſt: he dwelleth more and more in their hearts by faith. He doth not onely knock at the doores of their hearts, as a paſſenger, but he comes in unto them, and makes his
<hi>abode</hi> with them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He dwels in them.</hi> He doth not onely dwell in their tongues, and in their underſtandings; but he dwelleth in their hearts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. He hath his throne in their wills, and affections. Thoſe that grow in ſuch an union as this with Chriſt, they have <hi>fruitfulneſſe</hi> for their <hi>character</hi> aſſigned by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>He that abideth in mee, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> He in whom Chriſt hath his abode, is no barren profeſſour, but is <hi>filled with the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory, and praiſe of God, Phil.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt as a man was <hi>the ſubject of a fulneſſe of grace.</hi> He had a <hi>twofold grace, the grace of his favour</hi> towards us, <hi>the grace of his ſpirit</hi> in himſelfe: and of both there was in him a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A fulneſſe</hi> 1 of the <hi>grace of his favour,</hi> love, and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. The Apoſtle aſcribes unto him riches of this grace, and affirmeth, that therein he hath abounded unto us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
1.7,8. neither is this barely affirmed, but as ſtrongly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the
<hi>effects,</hi> or <hi>fruits</hi> thereof, 1. In our <hi>juſtification, In whom we have redemption, the forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> according unto the riches of his grace, &amp;c. both of which are plenary, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
130.7. <hi>In him there is plenteous redemption. He will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon, Iſay</hi> 55.7. or he will multiply to pardon, as it is in the margent. 2. In our <hi>vocation. In the riches of his grace he hath abounded towards us in all wiſdome and prudence, ver.</hi> 8. Thus alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. the
<hi>Lord</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>rich;</hi> to wit, in mercy, love, and favour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all that call upon him.</hi> Where by
<hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Diodati</hi>) is meant Jeſus Chriſt, who by his death &amp; reſurrection hath gotten himſelfe a title<pb n="215" facs="tcp:168371:108"/>over all men, to be their Lord &amp; maſter, &amp; to be the head of the elect amidſt all Nations. And he is ſaid to be rich in the fruits and effects thereof: For (as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place obſerve) <hi>rich</hi> is here taken <hi>actively,</hi> for bountifull, liberall, or gracious. The bounty and liberality of men may be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by extenſiveneſſe unto too many: but it cannot be ſo with the grace, love, and favour of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for he hath unſearchable riches, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. that cannot be impaired by communicativeneſſe. He cannot be impoveriſhed, though he be <hi>rich unto all that call upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fulneſſe of Chriſts love is to the full diſplayed in the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> and that both in the Churches
<hi>confeſſions,</hi> and Chriſts owne <hi>profeſſions</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. In the Churches <hi>confeſſions</hi> of it, and that both to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>others.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> we have Chriſts owne <hi>profeſſion</hi> of this great love of his unto his Church. He termeth her <hi>his love, his dove, his ſpouſe, his ſiſter, his beloved, his friends, Chap.</hi> 5.
<hi>v.</hi> 1. He acquaints her, that in expreſſion of his love unto her, he had endured much trouble, and miſery for her. <hi>My head</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night, Chap.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>Unto the Churches <hi>confeſſion,</hi> and Chriſts owne
<hi>profeſſion</hi> of this fulneſſe of love, we joyne alſo the Churches <hi>petition</hi> for it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Set me as a ſeale upon thy heart, as a ſeale upon thine arme.</hi> This was a prayer dictated unto, and penned for<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168371:109"/>the Church, by the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe; and therefore, if ſhe put it up with faith and confidence, it cannot be ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. From it then we may conclude, that the Church is very precious in Chriſts eſteeme, <hi>graven as the graving of a ſeale upon his heart.</hi> And this his eſtimate of her he will manifeſt by wearing her as a ſignet upon his right hand. The high prieſt,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>was to beare the names of the children of Iſrael engraven upon twelve precious ſtones, and ſet in gold, in the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of judgement, upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memoriall before the Lord continually, verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 29.</p>
            <p>Herein the exceeding and wonderfull care and love of Chriſt unto his members is plainly typified, and that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The names of the children of Iſrael were engraven upon twelve precious ſtones, ſet in gold, to ſhew, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt are very deare and precious unto him, as it were his jewels, and precious ſtones,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Beſides,</hi> there was curious art beſtowed upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving of theſe names. It was like the <hi>engraving of a ſignet, ver.</hi> 21. And this might figure the curioſity of Chriſts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in creating and engraving holineſſe, the image of God, upon the ſpirits of his people, which farre exceeded that which was uſed in the framing of thoſe glorious, and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies, the ſunne, moone, and ſtarres. And the curioſitie of this his workmanſhip in the beautifying of his members is a demonſtration of his extraordinary affection unto them.</p>
            <p>3. His care of them, and affection to them, is not onely
<hi>joynt</hi> and <hi>generall,</hi> but <hi>particular</hi> and
<hi>ſeverall,</hi> of one by one.
<note n="*" place="margin">Babington <hi>in locum.</hi>
               </note> The High prieſt was to have in his breſt-plate the twelve ſtones, with the particular names of the Tribes.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſt beareth his members not onely on his ſhoulders,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 12. by his <hi>protection</hi> of them, and <hi>patience</hi> unto them; but in his breaſt and heart, by his <hi>ſingular</hi> and moſt
<hi>tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> towards them. While he was here on earth his heart was ſo ſet upon them, as that he ſhed his heart blood for them. And now he is gone <hi>into the holy place:</hi> they are ſtill upon, and in his heart; he is ſtill mindfull of, and deeply ſollicitous for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:168371:109"/>promoting their ſalvation. He even now <hi>rejoyceth in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable part of his earth:</hi> and there will never be a period <hi>in his delights with the ſonnes of men, Prov.</hi> 8.31. the twelve ſtones are termed <hi>Exodus</hi> 25.7. <hi>lapides</hi>

               </gap>: that is, ſtones of fulneſſes, or filling ſtones. Perhaps (thinks <hi>Altingius loc. com. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 1.) becauſe the breaſt plate was filled with them, and this might ſignifie, that the breaſt, or heart of Chriſt was even filled with his members, in regard the love of his heart was fully placed upon them, more then on all the reſt of the creatures.</p>
            <p>5. The High Prieſt was to beare the names of the children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> for <hi>a memoriall before the Lord continually.</hi> And this might denote, that Chriſt is ever mindfull of his people. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the ſonne of her wombe? yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee, ſaith the Lord Chriſt unto his Zion, Iſay</hi> 49.15. Chriſt remembreth all his people, even when as man he ſeeth them not. And this might be imported by the High Prieſts bearing the <hi>names of the children of Iſrael upon his two</hi>

<hi>Apoſtle Paul, Ep.</hi> 3.18,19. then which no one place of Scripture more fully expreſſeth the tranſcendency of Chriſts love unto us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. He aſcribes unto Chriſt's love one dimenſion more then <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> attribute unto bodies, not onely

To take them off from this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening conceit, the Apoſtle tels them, that the love of Chriſt is ſo incomprehenſible, as that it ſurpaſſeth all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our wits fully to conceive it in our minds; and therefore it is able to puzzle and non-plus them, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that vainly boaſt a knowledge of darke and hidden my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</p>
            <p>Unto theſe teſtimonies I ſhall adde two other arguments of the fulneſſe of Chriſts love. 1. The <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of it: And 2. the <hi>unmeaſurableneſſe</hi> of it's fruits or effects.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>abſolute freeneſſe</hi> of it: It was neither for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as an <hi>end,</hi> nor for our deſervings, as a
<hi>motive.</hi> He firſt loved us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>While we were ſinners Chriſt died for us, Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Sonne, verſ.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>As it is unmerited, ſo ſecondly, its fruits and effects, to wit, his <hi>purchaſe,</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of our
<hi>redemption,</hi> are <hi>unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> by our underſtandings here in this life.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>His purchaſe</hi> of our redemption, not by
<hi>corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious bloud of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18,19. did ſo farre exceed humane reaſon, as that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereunto a rocke of offence. <hi>Greater love</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>hath no man, then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friend, Joh.</hi> 15.13. But he himſelfe hath given us a greater expreſſion of his owne love. He hath laid downe his life for enemies, for traytours and rebels: and beſides, this life, that he laid downe, cannot be equalled by the lives of the greateſt of all the ſons of men; For it was the life of the Son of God, and therefore of peereleſſe, and ineſtimable value, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>2. As for his <hi>application of our redemption,</hi> if we endeavour to ſearch it unto the bottome, it will be found farre to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount humane reach. Is not the <hi>originall</hi> of it, our election,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:168371:110"/>one of the moſt myſterious points in all Divinity? are not the <hi>parts</hi> of it, vocation, juſtification, adoption, ſanctification, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, all matters of perplext difficulty?

<hi>fulneſſe of Chriſt's love</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p>1. It yeilds abundant conſolation unto all true believers. That may be ſaid of them, which was propheſied <hi>of Naphtali, Deut.</hi>
33.23. <hi>They ſhall be ſatisfied with favour, and full of the bleſſing of the Lord. The earth is full of the goodneſſe of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 33.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſome</hi> hold, did commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate the impenitent Jewes, and wept over them, Luk. 19.41. O then what yearning of bowels, what tenderneſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is there in him by <hi>vertue of his office, as he is media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> towards thoſe, whom his father hath given him. If our hearts be ſad, and diſconſolate, our ſpirits weary, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and heavy laden with the ſenſe of ſinne. Why Chriſt's love (ſaith the Church) <hi>is better then wine, Cant.</hi> 1.2. Wine is a very comfortable creature, <hi>making glad the heart, Pſal.</hi> 104.15. and the life merry: <hi>It maketh the needy and thoſe that are of heavy heart to forget their poverty, and remember their miſery no more, Prov.</hi> 31.6,7. and therefore may very well by a
<hi>ſynecdoche,</hi> be put for all worldly delights. The words then may be thus paraphraſed; Thy love is ſweeter, more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, pleaſant, and rejoycing the heart, then the choiceſt of earthly pleaſures. If we are aſſayled by our Corruptions within, by temptations, afflictions, and perſecutions without, why Chriſt's love is a <hi>banner</hi> over us, animating us to quit<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168371:111"/>our ſelves as becommeth the ſouldiers of the Lord of Hoſts: for the uſe of a banner, ſtandard, or enſigne is, as to draw and keepe ſouldiers togeither, Iſay. 5.26. and
11.10. So alſo to encourage them, Pſal, 60.4. <hi>thou haſt given a banner to them that feare thee; that it may be diſplayed, becauſe of the trueth.</hi> If the great men of the world be averſe from us, ſlight, and contemne us, it matters not, Chriſt's deſire is unto us, <hi>Can.</hi>
7.10. He will put us as a ſeale upon his heart, and his arme, <hi>Can.</hi>
8.6. Though we have but little favour with the world, we have a fulneſſe of favour, riches of grace, with Chriſt. We ſhould not be diſcouraged at the unſpeakable, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable malice, and hatred of our rageing perſecutors, as long as we have an unexpreſſible, and incomprehenſible love of Chriſt to oppoſe unto it. We ſhould not be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>depth's of Satans envy,</hi> and malignity, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.24. For in Chri'ſts love there are all <hi>dimenſions.</hi> We ſhould not afflict our ſelves for our povertie, meanneſſe of birth, and calling, and the like outward abaſures: For none of them exclude from the grace of Chriſt. He is rich unto all that call upon him; We ſhould not therefore deſpaire of pardon, though guilty of many and great enormities. For <hi>Chriſt's love paſſeth knowledge,</hi> the comprehenſion of men, or Angels; and therefore
<hi>hideth,</hi> covereth, nay quite burieth a multitude of ſins, All the ſinnes of believers.</p>
            <p>But now that prophane perſons may not abuſe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine of the fulneſſe of Chriſt's love, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to take notice of the <hi>character,</hi> that the Scripture giveth of thoſe, unto whom it is appropriated. <hi>The riches of his Glory:</hi> that is, glorious grace is made <hi>knowne only on veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of mercy, Rom.</hi>
9.23. and <hi>veſſells of mercy</hi> are <hi>veſſells unto honour, ſanctified, and meet for the maſters uſe, and prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every good worke,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is rich in mercy, but it is only unto thoſe, that call upon him, to wit, out of an unfeigned faith, and undiſſembled love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. that have a Spirit of prayer, and ſupplication powred upon them.</p>
            <p>2. From this fulneſſe of Chriſts love we may be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>three dutyes,</hi> 1. <hi>Thankefulneſſe</hi> for it. 2. <hi>A diligent<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168371:111"/>ſtudy,</hi> and 3. <hi>a carefull imitation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Thankefulneſſe</hi> for it. <hi>We will remember thy love more then wine,</hi> (ſaith the Church unto Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi>
1.4.) But ſhe hath a thankfull tongue, as well as heart; as ſhe remembreth it <hi>inwardly</hi> in her ſelfe, ſo with joy and triumph ſhe
<hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> publiſheth, and manifeſteth it unto others.
<hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. And this her recognition, and commemoration of Chriſts love, is not in a formall, dull, cold, and unpracticall way: for it hath ſuch an impreſſion upon her heart, as that it makes her even <hi>ſicke with the love of him, Cant.</hi> 2.5. It begets in her a love of a moſt powerfull and unconquerable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is a love
<hi>as ſtrong as death, Cant.</hi> 8.6. that is, it is as forcible, and irreſiſtible, trampling upon, and breaking through all difficulties, that occurr in <hi>performance</hi> of duties unto, or <hi>undergoing</hi> of ſufferings for Chriſt. This love is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed into jealouſy, and this jealouſy is as <hi>cruell,</hi> or <hi>hard as the Grave, ibid.</hi> that is, as inexorable unto all the enemies of Chriſt, unto her moſt profitable and pleaſant ſins, her darling and moſt indulged luſts. This love is for its intenſiveneſſe, motion upwards unto heaven, and conſumptive efficacy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto fire, <hi>ibid. The coales thereof are as coales of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Fire is the hotteſt of elements. So the Churches love of Chriſt is more ſolidly intenſe, then her love of any creature whatſoever. She is as it were all in a fire with the love of him.</p>
            <p>2. The motion of fire is upwards towards heaven. The love of Chriſt is as a fiery Chariot, whereby a ſoule is carried up unto heaven.</p>
            <p>3. Fire burnes all things combuſtible. So love of Chriſt conſumeth all a mans corruptions. And whereas elementary fire may be quenched, the love of Chriſt is a celeſtiall flame. <hi>Many waters cannot quench it, neither can the flouds drowne it, Cant.</hi> 8.7. It cannot be extinguiſhed, or abated by cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place it is ſo ſincere, and incorrupt, as that it cannot be bribed by any treaſure. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be contemned, ib.</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:168371:112"/>If your love of Chriſt reach not this height we have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, it comes ſhort of a due gratitude: we are unthankfull for Chriſts fulneſſe of love, if it be not as a loadſtone to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from us a love of him with all our hearts, ſoules, and might. In the language of the Scripture we are utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of Chriſts love, if it do not
<hi>conſtraine</hi> unto duty, and <hi>reſtraine</hi> from ſin. We deſpiſe the riches of Chriſts goodneſſe, grace and bounty, forbearance and long-ſuffering, if it do not lead us unto a ſtrict and ſevere repentance.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The fulneſſe of Chriſts love</hi> may provoke unto a moſt diligent ſtudy of it. It is an inexhauſt fountaine, an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomeable ocean, a bottomeleſſe &amp; unſearcheable mine. There is therefore more then enough in it to ſatisfy the reſtleſſe inquiries of thoſe, that are moſt curious and thirſty after knowledge. In
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.13,16,17,18. There be 4. <hi>Motives</hi> unto this ſtudy of Chriſts love. 1. <hi>The comprehenſiveneſſe,</hi> 2. <hi>the incomprehenſibleneſſe of this love,</hi> 3. <hi>The ſubject, and</hi>
4. <hi>the influence of the knowledge thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The comprehenſiveneſſe of the Love of Chriſt: It takes in all the

And hereupon that great <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> reſolved to ſtudy private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to preach publikely nothing, but what did ſome way or other referre unto that great expreſſion of Chriſts love, his death upon the croſſe, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> Indeed Chriſts love is the
<hi>epitome,</hi> and <hi>center,</hi> the fulfilling of<pb n="223" facs="tcp:168371:112"/>both Law and Goſpell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>it was out of love,</hi> that he performed the duties, and ſufferd the penalties of the law for us. It is <hi>out of love,</hi> that he hath revealed and will accompliſh the promiſes of the Goſpell unto us.</p>
            <p>A ſecond <hi>motive</hi> unto the ſtudy of the love of Chriſt is the <hi>incomprehenſibleneſſe</hi> of it. It paſſeth knowledge; and therefore though we arrive unto never ſo great a degree in our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the love of Chriſt, yet ſtill there will be a <hi>terra incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> place for new and farther diſcoveries. Chriſts
<hi>love</hi> is a ſtructure of vaſt, indeed infinite, extent: It is as it is ſaid of God, <hi>Iob.</hi> 11.8,9. <hi>As high as heaven, deeper then hell, larger then the earth, and broader then the ſea:</hi> and therefore impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould exactly meaſure it in all theſe dimenſions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let us labour to meaſure it as exactly as we can, that we may comprehend ſo much of the length, breadth, depth, and height thereof, as is diſcoverable by the ſaints here in this life. The <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt then, is a moſt ſpacious object for <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,</hi> in the meditation of which, we may exerciſe our ſelves day and night, and into which (to uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>nos quaſi demergamus,</hi> we may as it were plunge our ſelves over head and eares, as into an ocean, that hath <hi>no bottome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>third motive</hi> in this place is from the proper, and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ſubject of this knowledge, <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints, &amp;c.</hi> The knowledge of Chriſts love is the priviledge of the ſaints; common unto all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: and withall, it is ſo proper and peculiar unto them, as that it belongs unto none, but ſaints. If thou haſt an effectuall, and applicative knowledge, though but in a remiſſe degree, of the tranſcendent love of Chriſt, thou art then a ſaint: and if thou art a gratious faint here on earth, thou maiſt be confident, that thou ſhalt be a glorious ſaint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But now if on the other ſide, thou liveſt &amp; dyeſt in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or meerely in a notionall, or uneffectuall knowledg of the love of Chriſt, thou can'ſt have no evidence of thy ſaintſhip. And if thou art not a ſaint here, thy portion will be with damned Fiends and Divels in hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:168371:113"/>A fourth motive is the <hi>influence of the</hi> knowledge of Chriſt's love, and that is 1. <hi>preſervative</hi> from fainting in tribulations here. 2. <hi>preparative</hi> for the allfulneſſe of God in heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Preſervative</hi> from fainting in tribulation here. And this may be gathered from compariſon of theſe <hi>verſes</hi> with the foregoing. For <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. The Apoſtle dehorts them from fainting at the newes of his troubles. <hi>I deſire that you faint not at my tribulation for you,</hi> and in the following <hi>verſes,</hi> he backes this dehortation with a moſt humble, and fervent petition, the preface unto which we have <hi>verſes.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>for this cauſe I bow my knee unto the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The matters, or things petitioned for are three, 1. <hi>Corroboration,</hi> and confirmation by the ſpirit of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>that he would grant you according unto the riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be ſtrengthned with might by his ſpirit in the inner man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A further union with Chriſt <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. and 3. which belongs unto our purpoſe, a <hi>practicall,</hi> and <hi>experimentall apprehenſion</hi> of the love of Chriſt, <hi>that ye may be able to comprehend with all ſaints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
            <p>By this coherence, you ſee, that a feeling and efficacious knowledge of Chriſts love, and the dimenſions thereof, will embolden and hearten the ſaints in their owne and others troubles, and as a ſoveraigne cordiall keep them from all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency and ſinking of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>A ſecond <hi>branch</hi> of its influence is
<hi>preparative</hi> for <hi>the all fullneſſe of God, verſ.</hi> 19.
<hi>I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, verſ.</hi>
14. <hi>that ye may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, &amp;c. and to know the love of Chriſt, &amp;c. that ye might be filled with all the fullneſſe of God verſ.</hi> 18, 19: that is, with a full knowledge of God in the beatificall viſion, the full image of God, a full participation of the divine nature, a full union with, &amp; fruition of God, full, and immediate influences from God, according unto that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>God ſhall be all in all:</hi> that is, in all the elect, he ſhall be <hi>vice omnium,</hi> inſtead of all ordinances unto their ſoules,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168371:113"/>inſtead of all meanes and helpes unto their bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I ſaw no temple therein, for the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it. And the city had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moone to ſhine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof, Revel.</hi> 21.22,23. The meaning of the place is, that God ſhall immediatly by himſelfe, ſupply the <hi>efficiency</hi> of all ſecond cauſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Before I leave theſe words, I ſhall out of them direct unto a
<hi>cauſe</hi> of the knowledge of the love of Chriſt; to wit, <hi>to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and grounded in love, verſ.</hi> 17. that is, either in our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love in Chriſt unto us, or elſe in the habit of our love unto God, and Chriſt. <hi>I bow my knees unto the father, &amp;c. that ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend &amp; know the love of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> They which are roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and grounded in love, are able to reach the dimenſions of Chriſts love, to <hi>know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A full and firme aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt unto us, and our firme and conſtant love of God and Chriſt, will put us upon a moſt induſtrious ſearch after all the ſecrets of Chriſts love unto our ſoules. Whereas on the other ſide, thoſe that either deſpaire or doubt of that love of God and Chriſt; as alſo thoſe that have but faint affections, and inconſtant deſires towards them; all ſuch make but a very ſlow progreſſe in the ſtudy and knowledge of Chriſts love.</p>
            <p>The laſt exhortation is unto an <hi>imitation</hi> of this fulneſſe of love. <hi>Walke in love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as Chriſt alſo hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and hath given himſelfe for us an offering, and a ſacrifice unto God, &amp;c, Epheſ.</hi> 5.2.

The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> directs us to conforme our ſelves herein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts love of us. <hi>Walke in love, as Chriſt hath loved us.</hi> There be <hi>foure</hi> things eſpecially, wherein our love of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould be conformable unto Chriſts love of us. 1. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi> 2. <hi>Freeneſſe.</hi> 3.
<hi>Selfe-denyall</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> 4. <hi>Reality of expreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conſtancy.</hi> As God, he hath loved us from everlaſting. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. As man, <hi>he loveth his owne in the world unto the end, Iohn.</hi> 13.1. That is, for ever. Our love of our Brethren ſhould therefore be perpetuall, and not be altered, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or abated by their petty unkindneſſes, much leſſe by the greateſt and moſt miſerable change of their outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Freeneſſe. He died for the ungodly, and for ſinners, Rom.</hi> 5.6,8. He loved us in the very height of our rebellion. How did he weep over Jeruſalem, and bemoane its ſad fate, though it were a place repleniſht with perſons, that breathed nothing but hoſtility againſt him? <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41,42. &amp;c. And at his death how fervently prayed he for the pardon of his rageing and inſulting crucifyers? <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. If we will walke by this patterne of Chriſts love, we muſt exerciſe ſome love unto the moſt impious and undeſerving wretches imaginable. We muſt <hi>love our enemies, bleſſe them that curſe us, doe good to them that hate us, and pray for them which despitefully uſe us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute us, Math.</hi> 5.44.</p>
            <p>3. Our love muſt be conformable unto Chriſts love, in the
<hi>ſelfe-denyall</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5,6,7,8. His love was ſo humble, as that it condeſcended unto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waſhing of his diſciples feet, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.

<hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. that is, our love ſhould be laborious and working, miniſtering unto the ſaints. Chriſts love was ſo liberall, as that he gave himſelfe, his blood, his life, his ſoule for us, and he communicates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the ſatisfaction and merit of his ſufferings, the graces of his ſpirit, and all his communicable prerogatives. There ſhould be likewiſe ſuch a franke diſpoſition in our love, as that we ſhould impart what we hold deareſt, for the good of Gods Church and people. We ſhould lay downe our lives for ſome brethren, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. Thus
<hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla for the life of Paul laid downe their owne necks, Rom.</hi> 16.3,4. Chriſt expreſſed his love in <hi>forgiving</hi> thoſe that <hi>offend,</hi> as well as in <hi>giving</hi> thoſe that
<hi>want.</hi> He forgiveth us <hi>ten thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> infinite treaſons and rebellions, we ſhould not therefore be inexorable unto our brethren for a <hi>debt of an hundred pence, Math.</hi> 18. from
<hi>verſe</hi> 24. unto the end of the <hi>chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed unto the <hi>ſecond fulneſſe</hi> of grace, that dwelleth and inhereth in Chriſt's humanity: The <hi>fulneſſe of the grace of the ſpirit,</hi> which ſhall be by me with all poſſible brevity, and plainneſſe 1. <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>cleared.</hi> 2.
<hi>confirmed.</hi> 3. <hi>applied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For <hi>explication.</hi> In the words of the Apoſtle, under this ſence, we have an <hi>adjunct, grace,</hi> ſet forth unto us 1. By its
<hi>extent,</hi> and <hi>excellency.</hi> 2. By its <hi>ſubject.</hi> 3. By its inheſion in that <hi>ſubject.</hi> 4. By its <hi>cauſe</hi> and
<hi>originall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of it is expreſſed in <hi>two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gradations:</hi> It was 1. <hi>A fulneſſe.</hi> 2. <hi>An all-fulneſſe</hi> of grace.</p>
            <p>2. Its <hi>ſubject</hi> was Chriſts humane nature; in
<hi>him,</hi> that is, in Chriſt as man.</p>
            <p>3. We have the <hi>inheſion</hi> of this <hi>adjunct, grace,</hi> in this <hi>ſubject, him,</hi> dwelleth. Of which terme I conceive choice is made, to denote, that this all-fulneſſe was in Chriſt after a permanent and fixed manner: it dwelled in him. Sutable to which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 11.
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi verbum requieſcit,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Suarez</hi>) <hi>ibi indicat permanentiam per modum habitus.</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:168371:115"/>The word
<hi>reſt</hi> ſignifieth the permanency and conſtancy of abode, that the ſpirit was to make in him: it was <hi>habitually</hi> to reſt in him.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, we have the <hi>cauſe of all,</hi> of all this fulneſſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him, the decree of the father. <hi>It pleaſed the father that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> Chriſt owed it not either to his owne, or others merits, but ſolely to the free purpoſe and independant pleaſure of heaven. Indeed the word <hi>father</hi> is not found in the Originall, yet it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and therefore rightly ſupplied by
<hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is followed by the beſt tranſlations. All that I ſhall ſay in farther unfolding theſe words, as underſtood of Chriſt's habituall grace, ſhall be in giving ſatisfaction unto theſe
<hi>two queſtions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>What is meant by this fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>How an all-fulneſſe of grace can be ſaid to be in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What is meant by this <hi>fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt? Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Delphinus</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> 1.14. puts a difference between theſe two expreſſions: <hi>To be full of grace;</hi> and <hi>to have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace.</hi> A river, nay a pit, or pond, the leaſt veſſell or meaſure may be full of water; only a fountaine, the ſea hath in it a fulneſſe of water. A ſtarr, a beame, nay a glaſſe inlightned by the Sun, may be full of light; only the Sun hath in it the fulneſſe of light. Even ſo divers of the ſaints, the <hi>virgin Mary, Iohn the Baptiſt, Zacharias, Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> are in Scripture ſaid to be full of the holy Ghoſt and grace; full as <hi>veſſells,</hi> as <hi>ſtreames:</hi> full as <hi>ſtarrs,</hi> as <hi>beames.</hi> But Chriſt only had in him the fulneſſe of grace: he was full of grace as a
<hi>fountaine,</hi> as a <hi>ſea,</hi> as a <hi>ſun.</hi> He was not only full of grace, but the fulneſſe of grace dwelled in him: ſo that in his grace there was an <hi>all-ſufficiency,</hi> an <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. An <hi>all-ſufficiency:</hi> ſufficient it was for
<hi>ornament unto himſelfe,</hi> and for <hi>influence</hi> upon others. He had ſo much, as was requiſite for the diſpenſation of all his offices, and for tranſacting all buſineſſes belonging to his Church, and as was neceſſary for his filling up all the emptineſſe of<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168371:115"/>grace, expelling all the fulneſſe of ſinne, and ſupplying all the defects, and wants poſſible in his members.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>An indeficiency:</hi> It will never faile.
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in the beginning of his 13. <hi>Homily</hi> upon the firſt of <hi>John,</hi> illuſtrates this by the examples of a
<hi>ſea,</hi> and a <hi>fountaine of fire:</hi> You cannot exhauſt the ſea, though you draw as much water out of it as you can; Though never ſo many rivers runne out of the ſea, yet will it never be drawne drie. Even ſo though all the ſaints, that were, are, or ſhall be, either did, doe, or ſhall receive of his fulneſſe, yet will he never be emptied, never the leſſe full for all that. The utmoſt that we receive, is but
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as a ſmall drop in compariſon of a botom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe abyſſe, and boundleſſe ſea. But
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thinkes this ſimilitude not ſufficient to ſet out the fulneſſe of Chriſts grace: becauſe if we take but a drop of the ſea, it makes ſome diminution, though it be unſenſible, and undiſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whereas the fountaine of grace in Chriſt cannot be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened in the leaſt degree, though it be never ſo much commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This ſimilitude being defective, he proceeds unto another.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>; &amp;c. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were a fountaine of fire; if you light never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lampes or candles thereat, you could diminiſh nothing therefrom, but ſtill it would be as full of fire as before. Even ſo what meaſures and portions ſoever of his ſpirit and grace Chriſt dipenſeth unto any, he is not a jot impaired thereby; but he hath ſtill a plentifull remainder, nay an all-ſufficient, an indeficient fullneſſe, an inexhauſtible fountaine, unemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible treaſures, an overflowing redundancy of ſpirit and grace.</p>
            <p>Fulneſſe of grace, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> noteth, <hi>qu.</hi> 7.
<hi>art.</hi> 10. may be taken either with regard unto the <hi>ſubject, him,</hi> that hath<pb n="230" facs="tcp:168371:116"/>grace; or elſe with regard <hi>unto grace it ſelfe;</hi> and ſo it is nothing elſe, but the perfection, and excellency of grace.</p>
            <p>1. With <hi>regard unto the ſubject of grace, him</hi> that hath it, with regard either unto <hi>his office, place, and condition requiring,</hi> or elſe <hi>capacity receiving grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is a fulneſſe of grace, conſidered in reſpect of the <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>ſtate of the ſubject,</hi> or partie that hath grace. When one hath it fully, perfectly, and ſufficiently, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtate and condition, to the utmoſt bound that God hath perfixt to them of ſuch a condition: and in all the vertue and efficacy of it, in that it extendeth to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all things, any wayes appertaining to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, office or ſtate, of ſuch as are of his place, and ranke. And ſuch a fulneſſe we have aſcribed unto many of the ſaints, unto the Virgin Mary, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.28. unto <hi>John Baptiſt Luk.</hi> 1.15. and unto his mother <hi>Elizabeth, verſ.</hi> 41. unto his father <hi>Zacharias, verſ.</hi> 67. and unto <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 6.8. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.55. All theſe had grace full, and enough for that place and condition, to which God had appointed them. <hi>Thus the Romans</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>full of goodneſſe, and filled with all knowledg, Rom.</hi> 15.14. Full after a ſort, full with ſuch a fulneſſe, as is proportionate unto the Age of Childhood, in which we here live. This fulneſſe may be greater or leſſer according to the various places, which thoſe unto whom is is diſtributed, beare in the Church, according to the ſeverall exigences and meaſures either of their <hi>condition</hi> in themſelves, or of their
<hi>ſervice</hi> in the Church. For the effuſion of the ſpirit of holineſſe is likened in ſcripture to the pouring forth of an oyntment. Now no oyntment at the skirts or edges of a garment, doth runne ſo freſh and full as on the upper parts. Upon the upper parts there is more conferred, the <hi>meaſure of the</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Biſhop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Ephah,</hi> double portions of the ſpirit. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſts <hi>precurſor,</hi> muſt be filled with the holy Ghoſt from his mothers wombe. The bleſſed Virgin, the ſacred veſſel of his incarnation, muſt have grace in greater fulneſſe, then other mortals. But now upon the edges, and skirts of<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168371:116"/>Chriſt's garment, Chriſt's body, the loweſt ranke of his members, there is conferred leſſe, the <hi>meaſure of the Hin,</hi> ſingle portions of the Spirit. Unto every one is diſpenſed grace ſufficient, <hi>ſufficient for</hi> themſelves, <hi>ſufficient for, full and adequate unto</hi> that worke, and employment, unto which they are deſigned.</p>
            <p>2 Fulneſſe of grace may be taken with regard unto the
<hi>ſubjects</hi> capacitie of receiving it: So the word
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth our conceit to place and meaſure, from whence it is borrowed, In which <hi>fulneſſe</hi> is nothing but a
<hi>commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the things, or bodyes contained, unto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining: Even ſo in Chriſt, a fulneſſe of grace is the
<hi>adequation</hi> of grace unto his capacity, his power of receiving grace. As a place or meaſure is then ſaid to be full of a thing, when it hath as much of it, as it can hold: So Chriſt is ſaid to be full of grace, in that he hath received ſo much grace, as his capacity would containe no more. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>capacity</hi> of a <hi>ſubject</hi> to receive an accident, one <hi>naturall;</hi> another <hi>obedientiall. A naturall capacity</hi> towards Grace Chriſts ſoule had not, ſeeing grace is <hi>altioris ordinis,</hi> of a ranke and order above nature. As for the <hi>obedientiall capacity</hi> of his ſoule to receive grace, that is nothing elſe, but the being of his ſoule conſidered as not repugnant to grace. And according to it his ſoule was capable of ſo much grace, as implied not a contradiction thereunto. This capacity the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> think that God filled up unto the brimme, ſo that if he ſhould ſtretch, nay rack his power unto the utmoſt, he could not poſſibly poure into the ſoule of Chriſt one, the leaſt drop, degree of grace more, then it was poſſeſt of already: not out of any deficiency in the divine power, but meerely for want of roome (as I may ſo ſpeake) in the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſtinted capacity of the ſoule to receive it. Now the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> on the other ſide hold, that their adverſaries in thus determining, do little better then over-ſaucily narrow, and limit the divine omnipotency. And for their owne parts thus reſolve it, That God in the infuſion of grace into Chriſts ſoule, did fill up its capacity ſo farre as it could be fil'd in reference onely unto Gods
<hi>ordinary,</hi> not <hi>abſolute power.</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:168371:117"/>And if I be not miſtaken, there is more moderation in their opinion, then in that of their adverſaries: For that Chriſt's grace was by Gods abſolute power capable of farther intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they make good <hi>ex parte gratiae, ex parte efficientis, ex parte ſubjecti, ex parte objecti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then <hi>ex parte gratiae:</hi> Grace is <hi>forma intenſibilis,</hi> a forme that hath degrees: and it is finite, and therefore capable of a farther <hi>intenſive</hi> enlargement.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ex parte efficientis.</hi> God is abſolutely omnipotent; and therefore able to produce whatſoever implieth not a contradiction. Now the increaſe of a finite grace in point of degrees implieth no contradiction.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ex parte ſubjecti.</hi> The grace of Chriſt is received in the <hi>obedientiall</hi> capacity of his humanity; and according unto that, his humanity was capable of whatſoever meaſure of grace God could produce.</p>
            <p>Laſtly <hi>ex parte objecti.</hi> The greateſt meaſure of grace can never be adequate, or commenſurate unto the object of grace, God, who is <hi>cognoſcibilis, amabilis,</hi> and <hi>participabilis in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceede unto the third acception of the fulneſſe of grace, I muſt remove an objection out of my way. It <hi>may be objected,</hi> that it were not an endowment ſufficient to qualify Chriſt for the relation of headſhip, to have ſo much grace, as would fill his capacity. His capacity might be but narrow, and ſo though he had as much grace, as he could receive, yet he might not have much, in that he might not be able to receive much. A ſmall veſſell may be full of any liquor, and yet containe no great quantity of it. Even ſo might Chriſt be full of grace in this ſence, and yet have no great meaſure of grace.</p>
            <p>Unto this ſome anſwere, that the humane nature in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that moſt intimate aſſociation of the natures, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and
<hi>humane</hi> in one perſon, had it's capacity, it's power of receiving grace, enlarged as much as might be: So that by means hereof it became larger, then the capacity of all the Angels in heaven, comprehenſive of more grace then they; nay, farre wider then it would have beene, if it had
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168371:117"/>not been joyned, or then it would be, if it ſhould be diſjoyned from the perſon of the word. But this is an opinion that

<hi>ſ.</hi> 2. Cenſures for groundleſſe and ſenceleſſe. He confeſſeth, that by union of both natures in one perſon, the
<hi>congruity</hi> for the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to receive from the divine nature a larger meaſure of grace, is much increaſed. Meeter it is, that from the Deitie there ſhould be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of a greater meaſure of grace unto that nature, in which the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of it <hi>dwelleth bodily,</hi> then unto another, not linkt unto it in ſo neere, and cloſe a tye. And then farther, he doth not deny but that by the conjunction of the manhood with the divine perſon and nature, the more <hi>neere, and immediate capacity of the ſoule,</hi> to receive grace, may be much enlarged. Seeing that even is us, our hearts, by the habit's and exerciſe of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per graces, are wonderfully dilated, and opened, as it were, made more comprehenſive, able to receive more grace, then otherwiſe. By Solomons Wiſedome and underſtanding the <hi>largeneſſe</hi> of <hi>his heart was even as the ſand, that is on the ſea ſhore,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29. <hi>I will runne the way of thy commandments when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart, Pſalm.</hi> 119.32. to wit, by holineſſe, and ſanctification. <hi>O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged,</hi> 2
<hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.11. to wit, by love, and affection. But now as for the
<hi>remote, obedientiall,</hi> and as it were the <hi>fundamentall capacity</hi> of the ſoule towards grace, of which the patrons of the forementioned opinion onely ſpeake, how the union ſhould ſtretch, and widen that, he cannot conceive. For that being undiſtinguiſhed from the very nature, and being of the ſoule; indeed being nothing elſe,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168371:118"/>but the ſoule it ſelfe, conſidered as compatible with grace, how can it poſſibly admit either of change, or encreaſe. Equall it is, alike large in all reaſonable and intellectuall creatures, and is not to be meaſured by any naturall or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall perfection of its ſubject, but is of it ſelfe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unto the receipt of any kind, or degree of grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the finite, and created being of an intellectuall nature.</p>
            <p>Not reſting therefore in this unſatisfying anſwere, we will in the next place ſhew, how that in Chiſt there was a fulneſſe of grace, not onely in regard to <hi>his capacity,</hi> his power of receiving it, but alſo in reſpect <hi>of</hi>

            <p>In his grace 2. There was a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of
<hi>degrees.</hi> He had grace, as farre forth, as it may be had in the greateſt excellency and intenſion, according to every degree of grace. The
<hi>Spirit was not given by meaſure unto him, John</hi> 3.34.</p>
            <p>And 3. There was in his grace a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of
<hi>Vertus.</hi> He had grace unto all effects, and purpoſes, whereunto grace doth, or can extend it ſelfe. Grace in him was a ground of merit, and ſatisfaction, a cauſe of grace in others: It ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his humane nature, and actions, well pleaſing to the pure eye of heaven, and communicated unto his ſoule ſuch a gracious, holy, and heavenly being, ſuch a tranſcendent beauty, and unmatchable perfection, as farre ſurpaſſed the united, and cumulated perfections of all the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now this fulneſſe of grace in reſpect of grace it ſelfe, in reſpect of its extent, meaſure, or degrees, vertue or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, was proper to Chriſt, agreeable unto none beſides him. For the dwelling of it in Chriſt, our
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> bringeth as an argument to prove him <hi>head</hi> of the Church, and of that it were not a good argument, had it not been adequate unto the <hi>head</hi> of the Church, had it agreed unto any other.</p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice concerning the <hi>firſt queſtion,</hi> what is meant by the <hi>fulneſſe of grace in</hi> Chriſt? It is nothing elſe you have heard, but an <hi>adequation</hi> of his grace unto his offices, that require it, a <hi>commenſuration</hi> of his grace unto his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city receiving it, the <hi>perfection</hi> of his grace in reſpect of
<hi>extent, degrees, and vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. Queſtion is, how an <hi>all-fullneſſe</hi> of grace may be ſaid to be in Chriſt's humane nature? An all fulneſſe is an infinite fulneſſe; Even as an all ſufficiency is an infinite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency. Now the fulneſſe of grace in Chriſts humane nature is not, cannot be infinite. For God <hi>created all things in meaſure, number, and weight, Wiſd.</hi> 11.20. And the grace of Chriſt is a created quality, inherent in his ſoule, a creature too: therefore finite it muſt needs be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:168371:119"/>For anſwere. All-fulneſſe may be underſtood, either <hi>abſolutely and ſimply,</hi> or elſe onely
<hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a ſort, in ſuch a kind: An all-fulneſſe of grace, <hi>abſolutely, and ſimply ſuch,</hi> cannot be in the manhood of Chriſt: For that is nothing elſe, but an infiniteneſſe of grace, which (we know) is proper to the Godhead: Now the manhood by being perſonally united to the Godhead, is not annul'd, nor eſſentially chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Upon this union there followeth no confuſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the natures, or transfuſion of the properties from one nature to another. In Chriſts humane nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there dwelled all-fulneſſe of grace, onely <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a ſort, in ſuch a kind. All the fulneſſe of grace that was, that could be found in a creature, at leaſt in reference unto Gods ordinary power; <hi>Secundum definitionem divinae ſapientiae,</hi> as
<hi>Aquinas</hi> reſolveth it, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 7. <hi>art.</hi>
12. that is (if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his language) to the uttermoſt bound, that the divine wiſedome, which hath ordered all things in meaſure, hath prefixt to the grace of intellectuall creatures. Even as the light of the Sunne is the greateſt, that God hath decreed unto the <hi>Luminaries</hi> of heaven: And the heate of fire is the moſt intenſe, which God hath deſigned unto elementary bodies. The <hi>Scotiſts</hi> are not content with this, but ſay farther, that the degree of Chriſt's grace was unpaſſable even by Gods abſolute power, which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> ſuppoſe, ſhortneth the hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, detracteth from the infiniteneſſe of his power, at leaſt in reference towards the production, and augmentation of grace; As if in powring grace into the ſoule of Chriſt, it were quite exhauſted.</p>
            <p>One thing more I ſhall intreate you to obſerve out of
<hi>Aquinas. p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 7. <hi>art.</hi> 11. where he diſtinguiſheth of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration of the <hi>habituall grace</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>Poteſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>duplicitèr conſiderari, uno modo, ſecundum quod eſt quoddam ens, alio modo ſecundum propriam rationem gratiae, &amp;c.</hi> The grace of Chriſt may be conſidered <hi>two</hi> manner of waies, either in regard <hi>of its being,</hi> as it is a thing, a quality, or elſe according to the <hi>nature of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In regard of its being, as it is a thing, a quality, ſo
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168371:119"/>it may be in ſome ſence ſaid to be infinite: Becauſe in the nature of grace it is not limited, bounded, or ſtinted, but includeth in it ſelfe whatſoever any way appertaineth to grace, or commeth within the <hi>intenſive, or extenſive compaſſe of it.</hi> Even as we ſay that the light of the ſunne is infinite, becauſe howſoever it be but a finite and created thing, yet in the nature of light it hath no limitation, bounds, or ſtint, but containeth in it ſelfe whatſoever any way appertaineth to light.

               <hi>in tert. part. Thomae t.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 22. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. that the grace of Chriſt may be conſidered either <hi>abſolutely, or relatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Abſolutely, intrinſecally, really,</hi> and
<hi>Phyſically</hi> as it is in<pb n="238" facs="tcp:168371:120"/>it's ſelfe, ſo it is finite, communicating unto his ſoule though a great, yet but a finite beauty, and perfection, and rendring it proportionate but unto a finite weight of glory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Relatively,</hi> as referred unto the grace of union, as conjoyned unto the divine, and infinite perſon of the ſonne, as it is the grace of the ſon of God. And ſo it is in ſome ſort infinite, not as though by this conjunction there were imparted to it any <hi>phyſicall, and reall perfection,</hi> onely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>morall</hi> eſtimation of things, it receiveth thereby a dignity, and excellency, anſwerable to that of the perſon, an infinite dignity, and excellency. For union of the manhood unto the divine perſon, &amp; nature in that perſon, <hi>relatively</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobleth and exalteth whatſoever belongeth unto the humane nature, in
<hi>manner</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> ſuitable to its nature and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Hence its bloud was the bloud of God: it's obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſufferings the obedience, and ſufferings of God, and therefore infinitely ſatisfactory &amp;, meritorious: its grace, and vertues, the grace and vertues of God himſelfe; and ſo conſequently however, <hi>in eſſe reali'</hi> of a finite nature, yet they were, <hi>in eſſe morali,</hi> of an infinite worth, and value, able to be the ground of an infinite merit, and the principle of influence upon an infinite number of men.</p>
            <p>Having done with the explication of the point, I ſhall in the next place goe on to the ſecond thing I propoſed, the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it.</hi> And here to cleare and confirme what we have by our Apoſtle aſcribed unto our bleſſed Saviour, I will 1. prove it <hi>to be ſo,</hi> and then demonſtrate <hi>why it is ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>it is ſo,</hi> is apparant by ſundry places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, out of which I will cull only thoſe that ſeeme to me moſt pregnant and pertinent.</p>
            <p>1. Of the purity and fulneſſe in Chriſts grace, &amp; holineſſe, there were divers types in the ceremoniall law of
<hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The curious embroidery, and glorious Cherubims of the vaile,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 26.31. <hi>And thou ſhalt make a veile of blew, and purple, and ſcarlet, and fine twiſted linnen of cunning worke, with Cherubims ſhall it be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The ſeparation of the <hi>Nazarites, Numb.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>3. The Altar of burnt offerings, which was ſtiled <hi>moſt holy,<pb n="239" facs="tcp:168371:120"/>Exod.</hi> 29.37. or the holy of holies, or holineſſe of holineſſes.</p>
            <p>4. The Altar of incenſe, that was to be <hi>overlaid with pure gold,</hi> that had no droſſe; <hi>and to have a crowne of gold round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:</hi> and therefore called the <hi>golden Altar, Numb,</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>5. The perfection required in their ſacrifices. Their burnt offerings of the heard and the flocke, were to be males <hi>without blemiſh, Levet.</hi> 1.3,10. and Chapt. 23.10. If their burnt offerings were of fowles, the <hi>crop of it with the feathers were to be pluckt away and caſt beſides the Altar, Levit.</hi> 1.16. Their meat-offerings were to be
<hi>without leaven, Levit.</hi> 1.11. which figured ſin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.1.
<hi>Math.</hi> 16.6,12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. Their peace-offerings alſo were to be unblemiſhed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.20. The heifer, of whoſe aſhes the water of ſeparation was to be made, was to be <hi>red without ſpot, wherein was no blemiſh, and upon which never came yoake, Numb.</hi> 19.2. And ſo might apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly typify Chriſt, who as he was red in regard of his bloudy paſſion, ſo he was alſo of an unſpotted and unblemiſhed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and altogether free from the bondage of any ſin whatſoever. The <hi>two Lambs that were to be offered day by day for a continuall burnt offering, were to be without ſpot, Numb.</hi> 28.3. The Paſchall lamb alſo was to be without blemiſh, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 12.5. and theſe prefigured Chriſt, <hi>A lambe without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> I
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. that is, without ſin: and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin in intellectuall creatures argueth a fulneſſe of grace and holineſſe. We may then conclude, that Chriſts holineſſe was full and perfect, becauſe it was blemiſhleſſe and ſpotleſſe.</p>
            <p>6. The unblemiſhedneſſe required in all the Prieſts, that miniſtered in the ſanctuary, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. <hi>à verſ.</hi>
17. <hi>uſ<expan>
                     <am>

            <p>7. The holy anoynting oyle deſcribed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.
<hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>&amp;c. the precious oyntment that ran downe upon Aarons beard,</hi> the high Prieſt, <hi>that went downe to the ſkirts of his garments, Pſalm.</hi> 134.2.</p>
            <p>Unto this we may adde 8. the holy garments and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the high Prieſts.</p>
            <p>1. His white and linnen ones, which were peculiar unto the day of attonement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.4.</p>
            <p>2. His rich and glorious ones, which he wore in his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:168371:121"/>ſervice, that were for <hi>glory and beauty, Exod.</hi>
28.2. deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at large throughout that whole chapter.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeake particularly of one ſingular ornament of the high Prieſt, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim;</hi> the
<hi>grammaticall</hi> ſignification of which, is <hi>lights,</hi> and
<hi>perfections.</hi> It was to be <hi>put in the breaſt-plate of judgment upon the high Prieſts heart, when he went in before the Lord, Exod.</hi>
28.30. And herein he was a type of Chriſt, the true high Prieſt, that
<hi>ſtood up with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Ezra</hi> 2.63. <hi>Gods holy one, with whom his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> light of knowledge, and perfection of purity, <hi>were alwaies to be, Deuter.</hi> 33.8. <hi>Two things</hi> are here typified concerning Chriſts gracious endowments; the
<hi>plenty</hi> and the <hi>excellency</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>plenty of them,</hi> and therefore it is in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, lights and perfections.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>excellency of them,</hi> imported by the joyning of the article in the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe lights, thoſe perfections: For this ſaith <hi>Ames</hi> in an oration of his touching this ſubject, is not without it's <hi>emphaſis,</hi> and might ſignifie, that the light of his knowledge, the perfection of his purity ſurpaſſeth that of all other creatures.</p>
            <p>9. And laſtly, The unction of <hi>Solomon Pſal.</hi> 45.7. was a type of Gods anoynting Chriſts humanity with the holy Ghoſt,
<hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. as appeareth by the Apoſtles applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pſalmiſts words unto Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. Now Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons unction in the Pſalme was not outward, <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,</hi> with materiall oyle,</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it is attributed immediatly unto <hi>God. God, thy God hath anoynted thee.</hi> Whereas the externall anoynting of
<hi>Solomon</hi> at his coronation day, was by <hi>Zadock</hi> the Prieſt, 1
<hi>King.</hi> 1.38.</p>
            <p>2. It is preferd unto that of his fellowes. <hi>God hath anoynted thee &amp;c above thy fellowes.</hi> And how his externall unction excelled that of his fellowes, cannot be evidenced out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But if we ſpeake of an <hi>inward, spirituall,</hi> and <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> anoynting of him, with gifts qualifying him for the office, and duty of a King, thoſe that are here termed his fellowes, fell farr ſhort of him. <hi>Solomons wiſdome excelled the wiſdome<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168371:121"/>of all the children of the Eaſt country, and all the wiſdome of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: for he was wiſer then all men; then Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the ſons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
4.30,31. <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore did very fitly typifie Chriſt, whom God anoynted with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes, in an higher and fuller ſenſe then him. Here we have a <hi>twofold compariſon</hi> of the infuſion of gifts and graces into Chriſts manhood: one of
<hi>ſimilitude;</hi> another of <hi>unequalls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of ſimilitude: tis reſembled unto an anoynting: <hi>God hath anoynted thee with the oyle of gladneſſe.</hi> And this oyle, unto which Chriſts habituall grace was likened, was not meere <hi>oyle of Olive,</hi> but mixed with precious <hi>ſpices, compounded after the art of the Apothecary, or perfumer,</hi> as it is ſaid of the ſacred oyle of the tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.25. and unto this oyle there is an apt reſemblance of the grace of the ſpirit in Chriſt, becauſe it anſwereth all the properties and effects thereof. This oyle was fragrant, yielding a ſweet ſmell. And what is ſaid of the name of Chriſt in generall, is appliable unto his graces in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.
<hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good oyntment, thy name is as oyntment powred forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</hi> Oyle ſtrengthned the body, ſo the grace of the ſpirit ſtrengthned Chriſt with might in the inward man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 16. It is ſaid of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.40. that he <hi>waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, being filled with wiſdome:</hi> and the reaſon of it is ſubjoyned: and <hi>the grace of God was upon him.</hi> With this oyle in thoſe times they beautified their faces; <hi>Oyle maketh mans face to ſhine,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. So the grace and holineſſe of Chriſt put a luſtre upon him, and made him to ſhine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly before God and man. This oyle was of a refreſhing nature; and therefore uſed in feaſts, and times of rejoycing. Whereupon it is termed the <hi>oyle of joy,</hi> and oppoſed unto <hi>mourning, Iſ.</hi>
61.3. The grace of Chriſts ſoule produceth gladneſſe and joy unſpeakeable, and that both in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, and his members, for whom he was anoynted: and therefore it is very fitly ſtiled the <hi>oyle of gladneſſe.</hi> The oyle in thoſe Eaſterne countries was ſo ſweet, as that <hi>Manna</hi> is for pleaſantneſſe of taſt compared unto it,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>The taſt</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:168371:122"/>
               <hi>of it was as the taſt of freſh oyle:</hi> or the beſt
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ainſworth.</hi>
               </note> moiſture of oyle. Thus the graces of Chriſt are delectable, and pleaſant unto every ſoule, that feeds on them by faith, and devout medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The end for which
<hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>his ſons were anoynted, was to conſecrate them, that they might miniſter unto the Lord in the Prieſts office, Exod.</hi> 30.30. So the deſigne in powring forth without meaſure the true oyle of anoynting, the Spirit, upon the Lord Chriſt, was the conſecration, authorizing, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of him, for the adminiſtration of all his offices.</p>
            <p>2. Here is a <hi>compariſon</hi> of Chriſts Unction with the ſpirit <hi>in point of quantity; a compariſon of unequalls: collatio majoris cum minoribus: He was anoynted with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here by <hi>fellowes</hi> may be underſtood thoſe that were ſuch in a <hi>ſpeciall</hi> or <hi>generall manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Thoſe that were ſuch in a <hi>ſpeciall manner,</hi> by peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, all Kings, Prieſts and Prophets: for they in thoſe times were anoynted; and therefore might in that reſpect be termed the fellowes of Chriſt, who was anoynted by God himſelfe, to be the King, Prieſt, and Prophet of the Church. And he was anointed <hi>above theſe his fellowes;</hi> becauſe all theſe <hi>three</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were conjoyned in him, &amp; in dignity ſurmounted theirs. Beſides, his abilities for them were vaſter then theirs.</p>
            <p>But 2. the fellowes of Chriſt may be underſtood in a
<hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way</hi> (unto which interpretation I incline, as the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) of thoſe, that are ſuch by that vocation, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto all beleivers: for they are all conſorts and ſharers with Chriſt in the unction of his ſpirit, and thereby are made <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God, Revel.</hi> 1.6. But now they were his fellowes, not in a way of
<hi>equality,</hi> but only in a way of <hi>ſubordination.</hi> He was anoynted above theſe his fellowes <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively,</hi> in regard of the number of his gifts and endowments; <hi>intenſively,</hi> in reſpect of the degree or meaſure. <hi>For the ſpirit was not given by meaſure to him, Job.</hi> 3.34.</p>
            <p>2. Of this fulneſſe that was to be in Chriſt, there ran di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe propheſies under the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 11.2. <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him.</hi> Others may have ſome feathers of the dove,<pb n="243" facs="tcp:168371:122"/>as it were, the firſt fruits of the ſpirit only: But upon him there deſcended the dove it ſelfe, the whole entire ſpirit; <hi>fons omnis ſpiritus ſancti</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Hierome</hi> upon the words) all the gifts and graces of the ſpirit: The
<hi>ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding; the ſpirit of counſell and might; the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord.</hi> And this deſcent of the ſpirit on him was not, <hi>ut avolaret, ſed jugiter permaneret,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Father</hi> hath it, <hi>It was to reſt upon him.</hi> Anſwerable to which was the record that <hi>Iohn</hi> bare, ſaying; <hi>I ſaw the ſpirit deſcending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him, John</hi> 1.32.</p>
            <p>2. A ſecond <hi>propheſie</hi> concerning this particular, we have in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24. where the <hi>Angell Gabriel</hi> informed
<hi>Daniel</hi> that Chriſt was to be the moſt Holy. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined to anoint the moſt holy.</hi> The moſt holy he was to be, not only <hi>eſſentially,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> but alſo as <hi>man;</hi> and ſo too, not only by the <hi>aſſumption of the word,</hi> but alſo by the <hi>ſanctification of the ſpirit,</hi> by infuſion of ſuch an unmeaſurable fulneſſe of habituall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as wonderfully exceedeth the joynt and cumulated holineſſe of all either Saints or Angells.</p>
            <p>A third Propheſie (and I will trouble you with no more) is
<hi>Zachary</hi> 3.9. <hi>For behold the ſtone that I have laid before Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua: upon one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes, behold I will engrave the graving thereof, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Unto which place an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that in the <hi>Revelation of Saint John, chap.</hi> 5.6. <hi>And I beheld, and lo, in the midſt of the throne, &amp;c ſtood a lamb, having ſeven hornes, and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven ſpirits of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Pemble <hi>on the place.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>ſtone</hi> in that place of <hi>Zachary</hi> is the chiefe corner ſtone, the head of the corner, Chriſt Jeſus, God bleſſed for ever. By <hi>eyes,</hi> is meant knowledge, wiſdome and providence. By <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> is denoted perfection and ſufficiency. By
<hi>engraving the graving thereof,</hi> is ſignifyed the beautifying, and as it were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of Chriſts humane nature, with all excellency of either gracious or glorious endowments. So that the words may be thus paraphraſed. Behold, I have laid in <hi>Sion</hi> for a foundation a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious cornet ſtone, a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 28.16. And this ſtone ſhall not be like the ſtones of the materiall Temple, a dead and ſenceleſſe, but a living and quickſighted ſtone: upon this ſtone ſhall be ſeaven eyes, a<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168371:123"/>fulneſſe of providence and wiſdome. This ſtone ſhall not be a rude, rough, unwrought, and unpoliſht, but a moſt curiouſly carved, and an artificially engraved ſtone, indeed the moſt beautifull of the whole building. Behold <hi>I will engrave the graving thereof, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> The Prophet alludes (thinke interpreters) unto the coſtly and curious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſtones of the Temple, which did in ſome weake manner ſet forth the riches and excellency of Chriſts gifts and graces.</p>
            <p>Theſe forementioned propheſies receive much light from thoſe many vulgar, and <hi>obvious ſimilitudes,</hi> under which the fulneſſe of Chriſt's grace is figured in ſcripture. I will touch but on a few.</p>
            <p>1. It is compared unto an excelling, and ſurpaſſing beauty, which is reſembled unto that of the <hi>roſe of Sharon, and lillie of the Valleyes, Canticl.</hi> 2.1. and is ſet out with moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite attire, and ornaments, ſweete perfumes and pretious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Behold, thou art faire my beloved, yea pleaſant, Cant.</hi> 1.16. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddie, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand. His head is as the moſt fine gold, his lockes are buſhie, and black as a raven. His eies are as the eies of Doves by the rivers of water waſhed with milke, and fitly ſet. His cheekes are as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers: his lips like lillies, dropping ſweet ſmelling myrrhe. His hands are as gold rings ſet with the Berill: His belly is as bright Ivory, overlaid with Saphires. His legges are as pillars of marble, ſet upon ſockets of fine gold: His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars. His mouth is moſt ſweete, yea, he is altogether lovely, Canticl.</hi> 5.10,11,12,13,14,15,16. <hi>He is the deſire of all nations;</hi> and the allurement of all hearts, that looke upon him.
<hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.7. <hi>All his garments ſmell of myrrhe, and aloes, and Caſſia, Pſal.</hi> 45.8. <hi>He is anointed with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes, Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thy name is as ointment powred forth, therefore do the Virgins love thee, Cantic.</hi> 1.3. What is ſaid of his Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. may be applied unto him in a farre greater emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency: he is perfumed <hi>with myrrhe and frankincenſe, with all powders of the merchant. In Revel.</hi> 1.13. <hi>he is girt about the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168371:123"/>paps with a golden girdle.</hi> On which words, that induſtrious Gentleman <hi>Mr Leigh</hi> hath this annotation. <hi>His girding about the paps and breaſts ſignifieth, that there is no defect, or aberration in any motion or affection in our Saviour Chriſt, but every thought, and inclination of his heart, is kept in order by the fulneſſe of the ſpirit:</hi> and he parallels it with <hi>Eſay.</hi> 11.5.
<hi>righteouſneſſe ſhall be the girdle of his loines, and faithfullneſſe the girdle of his reines:</hi> that is, he ſhall have ſo much of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and faithfulneſſe, as that it ſhall ſerve him for a girdle: By it he was girt; that is, ſufficiently prepared and made ready for execution of his office.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſts fulneſſe of grace is ſet forth by the ſimilitude of an apple tree. <hi>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons. As the Apple tree</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Ainſworth</hi> upon the words) <hi>hath more variety of fruits, then any other tree, that groweth, (that it is not eaſy to reckon up the many ſorts of Apples of different taſt) ſo Chriſt excelleth in variety of graces, &amp;c. The Chaldee Paraphraſt expoundeth this of the pomecitron tree; but for the cauſe aforeſaid I would not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>reſtraine it to any one kind, that the fulneſſe of grace and truth, which was in Chriſt, might here be obſerved.</hi> The beſt of the ſons of men are in compariſon of Chriſt but as trees of the wood: they are either barren, or elſe they yield no fruit but what is at leaſt in part ſowre, and unſavoury. But now Chriſt is like an apple-tree, becauſe his graces do as farre tranſcend thoſe of the choiceſt ſaints, as the ſweeteſt apples doe ſloes, graks, or acorns.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſts fulneſſe of grace is ſet forth by the expreſſion of <hi>a fountaine. A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and ſtreams from Lebanon, Canticl.</hi> 4.15. <hi>A fountain ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of Shittim, Joel.</hi> 3.18. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountaine opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe, Zach.</hi> 13.1. Chriſt was full of grace, as a fountain of waters. Now in the narroweſt fountaines there is ſuch a plenitude of waters, as is alwaies living, never decaying. Whereas let the greateſt pits and torrents be never ſo full, yet the water in them will ſtill grow leſſe and leſſe, But of this before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:168371:124"/>Chriſt 4. for his fulneſſe of grace is compared unto the ſunne, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The ſunne of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Whereas the beſt of the ſaints were but
<hi>ſtars,</hi> and <hi>beam's</hi> of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And however one ſtarre differ from another in light, and magnitude, yet they all come ſhort of the ſunne. The light of the ſunne is enough for the whole viſible world. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is ſufficient for all the members of the Church. No eye can overlooke the light of the ſun. No faith can comprehend, or overclaſpe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. He was a
<hi>ſunne of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Chriſt for his fulneſſe of grace is reſembled unto a King. <hi>He is a king of righteouſneſſe, Heb.</hi> 7.2. And therefore he hath an abundance, even a kingdome of righteouſneſſe. For being a king of righteouſneſſe, it is probable, that he is not poore in it, but that he hath even riches, and treaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to diſpenſe, beyond the capacitie, or comprehenſion of all the faith, that is, ever was, or ſhall be in the world.</p>
            <p>6. The unmeaſurable plenitude of Chriſt's grace, and holineſſe, is laſtly figured under the ſimilitude of riches, and treaſures. <hi>There are unſearchable riches in Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 3.8. And one branch of theſe riches is his grace, and wiſedome. Now riches denoteth not onely the <hi>precious worth,</hi> and high value, but the
<hi>plenteouſneſſe</hi> alſo, the fulneſſe of a thing. Chriſt therefore was full of grace, and wiſedome. But in Chriſt's grace, and wiſedome, there was not onely <hi>plenty,</hi> but <hi>immenſity;</hi> There was no end, or bottom of his riches; they were <hi>unſearchable riches. In him are hid all the treaſures of</hi> wiſedome and knowledge,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. and what is ſpoken of knowledg, may be ſaid of all other habituall gifts, and graces in Chriſt. The metaphor of treaſures, as that of riches, ſignifieth <hi>two things.</hi> 1 That the knowledge and wiſedome of Chriſts manhood are <hi>precious qualities,</hi> they are
<hi>treaſures:</hi> and treaſures are made up, not of priceleſſe pebbles but precious mettals, gold, and ſilver, or rich pearles, and Jewels.
<hi>Wiſdome is better then rubies: and all the things that may be deſired, are not to be compared to it, Prov.</hi> 8.11.</p>
            <p>2. That the Manhood of Chriſt is enriched with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:168371:124"/>and wiſdome in a very <hi>full and tranſcendent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith not, In him are hid <hi>knowledge and wiſedome,</hi> but the <hi>treaſures of knowledge and wiſedome:</hi> ſome few pieces of ſilver and gold, nay ſome pretty tolerable ſummes, amount not to treaſures: They are vaſt heaps. Even ſo not a meaſure, but a fulneſſe is required unto the treaſures of knowledge and wiſdome. But now in Chriſt were not onely <hi>ſome</hi> treaſures, but
<hi>all</hi> the treaſures. <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge.</hi> As the terme <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> points us unto the abundance and fulneſſe: ſo the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete all,</hi> all treaſures, plainly noteth the redundance, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his knowledge and wiſdome.</p>
            <p>There is in Chriſts knowledge a threefold fulneſſe: a
<hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſorts or kinds, a fulneſſe of degrees, a fulneſſe of objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A fulneſſe of ſorts or kinds; <hi>wiſdome</hi> and
<hi>knowledge;</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which regards things <hi>dogmaticall;</hi> and knowledge, which reſpects things <hi>practicall. The ſpirit of wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell, &amp;c, the ſpirit of knowledge, &amp;c. Iſaiah</hi> 11.2.

The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> reckon up three ſorts, or kinds of Chriſts cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. The knowledge of the <hi>beatificall viſion.</hi> 2.
<hi>Infuſed</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 3. <hi>Acquiſite</hi> knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. The knowledge of the <hi>beatificall viſion, ſcientia beata,</hi> and<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168371:125"/>for this they quote, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. where the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is of the praeterperfect tenſe, and ſignifieth that Chriſt was then already aſcended into heaven which could not be true of a bodily aſcent, but of a ſpirituall, by the <hi>beatifick viſion.</hi> But by the ſight of Gods eſſence we cannot know the decrees of God, or the creatures in themſelves: for the Angels enjoyed it, and yet know not thereby the <hi>day of judgment, Mark.</hi> 13.32. nay they were ignorant <hi>of the manifold wiſdome of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternall purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Which was made known unto them by voluntary revelation, and manifeſtation of the ſame, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9,10,11. The glorious ſaints have an uninterrupted viſion of the Deity, and yet cannot by vertue of it diſcerne any thing concerning the affaires and occurrences of this life. <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledgeth us not, Eſay.</hi> 63.16. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therefore was not enough for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place, there was in him an <hi>infuſed</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, by which eſpecially he knew things, that were not knowable, or diſcernable by the light of nature, or reaſon: <hi>He was filled with wiſedome, and the grace of God was upon him, Luk</hi> 2.40. The wiſedom with which he was filled, was from the grace of God upon, or in him. Of this wiſedome he ſhewed forth ſuch effects, when he was but <hi>twelve yeares</hi> old, as bred aſtoniſhment in all his auditors, <hi>verſ.</hi>
46, 47. <hi>They found him in the Temple, ſitting in the mid'ſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them queſtions. And all that heard him, were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding and anſwers.</hi> For it they farther alleadge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5,6,7,8,9. Hence <hi>Suarez, Becanus,</hi> and others generally thus <hi>argue. The Apoſtle here ſaith expreſſely, that Chriſt in his firſt comming, or entrance into the world, knew the will of the father, and the myſtery of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, knew that God would not be pacified, or appeaſed with mankind by Moſaicall ſacrifices, but by his bloudy death, and paſſion. And this will of God he himſelfe accepted, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon voluntarily offered his life for the ranſome of mankind, and thereby purchaſed our ſanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There was in him an <hi>acquiſite,</hi> or
<hi>experimentall</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, gotten, and gained by experience; and for this they<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168371:125"/>quote, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Though he were a ſonne, yet learned he obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things which he ſuffered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There was in his knowledge a <hi>fulneſſe of degrees:</hi> and therefore his increaſe in wiſdome, ſpoken of <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. is
<hi>extenſive</hi> only, and not <hi>intenſive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There was in his knowledg a <hi>fulneſſe of objects.</hi> Some Schoolemen have affirmed, that Chriſt, as man, even in this life, knew all creatures poſſible. Moſt of them averre, that he knew all things paſt, preſent, and to come. <hi>Becanus</hi> limits the extent of Chriſt's infuſed knowledg onely unto all things concerning men, Angels, and himſelfe. We for our parts ſhall preſume onely to ſay, that he alwaies knew all things, in every article of time, that then was <hi>neceſſary for</hi> our <hi>ſalvation, and the execution of his owne office.</hi> Diſtinguiſh we muſt betwixt his ſtate of <hi>humiliation, and exaltation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>In his ſtate of exaltation, and glory,</hi> he exerciſeth in order unto his Church a Lordſhip, and dominion over all things. And it is very probable, this his knowledg is as vaſt as his Empire.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> knew the names of all his ſouldiers: and therefore it is unlikely, that Chriſts humanity ſhould be ignorant of any thing made ſubject unto it. He is to be judge of men &amp; Angels, as he is the ſonne of man. <hi>The father hath given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the ſonne of man, John</hi> 5.27. And therefore, as man, he knoweth all things, that are to come within his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, as judge. The very ſecrets of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>The hidden things of darkneſſe, and the counſels of the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. But now this knowledge of Chriſt, as man, is not by force of the humane nature, but by infuſion, or revelation from the divine.</p>
            <p>2. As for his ſtate of <hi>humiliation,</hi> the fulneſſe of his knowledge in that was conſiſtent, 1. with the <hi>neſcience</hi> of divers things. He knew not, as man, the day of judgment, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32. the barrenneſſe of the figg-tree, <hi>Marke</hi> 11.13.2. With increaſe in his knowledg: For in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.52. <hi>He is ſaid to increaſe in wiſdome and ſtature, &amp;c.</hi> He is ſaid to increaſe in Wiſdome, in the ſame ſence, wherein he is ſaid to increaſe in ſtature: for they are both coupled togeither by <pb n="250" facs="tcp:168371:126"/>
               <hi>Luke:</hi> But he increaſed in ſtature <hi>really,</hi> indeed, and in truth, and not onely in the opinion of men; and therefore alſo there was a reality in the growth of his wiſedome. For this alſo our Divines uſually alleadge,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.40. <hi>And the child grew, and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdome, and the grace of God was upon him.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>filled,</hi> denoteth three things.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> that was in the wiſedom of Chriſt: He was full of wiſedome.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The dependancy</hi> of it upon it's <hi>efficient;</hi> Chriſt, as man, was filled with wiſedome, to wit, by God. The humanity did not, could not fill it ſelfe, but was repleniſhed by the Deitie.</p>
            <p>3. We have here implied the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> or <hi>terminus à quo</hi> of this his fulneſſe, to wit, a deniall of the anteceſſion thereof. The Child grew, &amp;c. and was filled with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He was filled then, and not before. The manhood was alwaies even from the very firſt moment of it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception full of wiſdome, according to the <hi>firſt act:</hi> And yet we ſee here, there is a fulneſſe of wiſedome <hi>de novo</hi> accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, to wit, in regard of actuall apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Againſt this <hi>Bellarmine tom.</hi> 1. <hi>De Chriſto. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2. alleadgeth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.1,2. <hi>There ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, &amp; a branch ſhall grow out of his roots. And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſedome and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell and might, the ſpirit of knowledg and of the feare of the Lord.</hi> All underſtand the place of Chriſt, who is ſaid to be a rod comming out of the ſtem of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and a branch growing out of his roots, even in his very conception, and even then the deſcent of the ſpirit of the Lord was upon him; And therefore the ſoule of Chriſt learned nothing afterwards, which before he knew not. The very ſame thing all thoſe places ſignify, where Chriſt is ſaid to be anoynted by God with the ſpirit,

But even as the divine nature did in ſome manner ſhut up or conceale and hide it's majeſty in it ſelfe in the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt, that it might not ſhew forth that dignity, which afterwards appeared in his exaltation. So alſo that ſpirit of wiſdome was held in or reſtrained, that it might not be put forth preſently in perfection, but by little and little, according to the ſtate of Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>There is a ſpirit of wiſdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is ability or promptneſſe, of underſtanding eaſily all things, which are neceſſary to be knowne, as occaſion requireth; Although all ſingulars be not actually knowne.</hi> 3.

            <p>The firſt place is, <hi>John.</hi> 1.14. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.</hi> Where by
<hi>grace</hi> ſome underſtand all <hi>morall vertues,</hi> that perfect the will, and affections; and by <hi>truth,</hi> all <hi>intellectuall vertues,</hi> that adorne, and beautify the underſtanding. <hi>Full he</hi> was of <hi>grace, to ſanctify; full of truth, to enlighten:</hi> Full <hi>of grace, becauſe the life; full of truth, becauſe the</hi> light <hi>of men:</hi> Full <hi>of grace,</hi> to <hi>expell our ſins; Full of truth,</hi> to <hi>diſpell our ignorance.</hi> The deſcant is <hi>Bonaventures</hi> on the place.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> place, with which I will conclude, is
<hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> There is <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo vaſis,</hi> and <hi>plenitudo fontis:</hi> the fulneſſe of a meaſure or veſſell, and the fulneſſe of a fountain. The fulneſſe of grace in the ſaints was like the fulneſſe of a meaſure: They had the ſpirit, but in meaſure. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one of us grace is given according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>As God hath dealt to every man a meaſure of faith, Rom.</hi> 12.3. Whereas the fulneſſe of Chriſt was the fulneſſe of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, without meaſure. <hi>He gave not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> Now the Spirit was the cauſe, and ground of all grace, and holineſſe. Having <hi>that</hi> then, not by meaſure, but in all fullneſſe, he muſt needs have of grace a fulneſſe. He was filled with the ſpirit of grace, anoynted with it all over: Therefore full of grace.</p>

            <p>2. It may be demonſtrated <hi>a gratiâ capitis,</hi> from his being <hi>head</hi> unto the Church. For in the head of the body
<hi>myſticall</hi> grace is to reſide in all eminency, and perfection, both
<hi>of parts, and degrees.</hi> Even as in the head of the body
<hi>naturall,</hi> there is a fulneſſe of ſence, All the five ſences. Whereas in the reſt of the members there is but one ſence, the ſence of touch, or feeling. The illuſtration is not mine, but <hi>Auſtin's, in the latter end of his</hi> 57<hi>th Epiſtle ad Dardanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this will be more appparent, if we will conſider, that Chriſt under this relation of head, is to <hi>be cauſa efficiens, and exemplar is,</hi> the principle, and patterne of grace, and holineſſe unto us, to <hi>fill up the</hi> emptineſſe of grace in us, to <hi>expell the fullneſſe</hi> of ſin out of us.

Even as the head in the naturall body is the cauſe of ſenſe, &amp; motion in the members; and therefore of grace, and holineſſe, there muſt be in him an all-fulneſſe. Even as in the

            <p>2. Chriſt under the relation of head, was to be an
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary cauſe,</hi> a patterne, and rule of Grace, and holineſſe, unto which our's muſt be proportioned. We muſt be holy, as he is holy, conformed unto his image, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Now <hi>primum, &amp; optimum in unoquoque genere</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi>) is <hi>menſura &amp; regula caeterorum.</hi> The rule, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the reſt in a kind, is to be the beſt, and chiefeſt of that kind. Of living creatures, we ſee the rule and meaſure is the perfecteſt, to wit, man; in whom we have couched, and that after an eminent manner, all the fulneſſe of life, all the degrees, and rancks of life, the vegetative, the ſentitive
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:168371:128"/>and reaſonable life, togeither with all the operations of each of theſe. Even ſo of thoſe, that live the life of grace, the rule and meaſure is to be the moſt perfect, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus; in whom the father decreed that grace ſhould dwell in all perfection. If we ſet either to our ſelves, or others, a ſampler to worke after, we will frame it as perfect, and abſolute, as we can. God hath ſet, and drawn Chriſt for a copy, unto which our ſanctity muſt be conformed. And will God (thinke you) deſigne any other beſides a perfect, full, and compleat copy. Shall there, can there be any imperfection in the Almighties draught of an examplar? Muſt our grace and holineſſe anſwere Chriſts exactly; and ſhall not his grace and holineſſe then be fully exact?</p>
            <p>Chriſt, <hi>thirdly,</hi> under the relation of head is to
<hi>fill up that</hi> emptineſſe of grace, which is in us. Even as the head in the naturall body is to ſupply the defects and wants in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. By nature there is in us an univerſall nakedneſſe, and emptineſſe; and emptineſſe of light, beauty, rectitude, peace, holineſſe, happineſſe in our whole man; A generall inepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and indiſpoſedneſſe towards whatſoever is good; nay in <hi>the beſt,</hi> even after regeneration, who have of grace a <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in regard of parts,</hi> there is yet an <hi>emptineſſe in reſpect of degrees.</hi> The meaſure of their graces is ſtill defective. Now Chriſt, in that he hath undertaken to repaire, and reſtore us unto our primitive condition, is to fill up this <hi>totall</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſſe, which is naturally in all of us; this <hi>graduall</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſſe, which is alſo in the beſt of us: and he that muſt thus ſupply our emptineſſe, muſt himſelfe be poſſeſt of a fulneſſe. He that is to ſatisfie the craving and demands of our extreame poverty, muſt have unſearchable riches. He muſt have all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto our unconceiveable ignorance. Becauſe our fleſh is devoid of grace and truth; <hi>In it dwelleth no good thing, Rom.</hi> 7.18. therefore that <hi>fleſh,</hi> which the <hi>word</hi> was made, for the redemption of ours, was to be repleniſhed with all good things, was to be
<hi>full of grace and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly: An all-fulneſſe of grace was neceſſary unto Chriſt, in that as our head, he was to <hi>expell</hi> the fulneſſe<pb n="256" facs="tcp:168371:129"/>of ſinne out of us. By nature, we are
<hi>filled with unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Rom.</hi> 1.29. We are full of filthineſſe, and deformity in fleſh and ſpirit, and overſpread from the head to the foot with blaines, and putrefactions. All the faculties of our ſoules are full of ſinne. Our minds are full of vanity, and darkneſſe. Our conſciences are full of impurity, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe. Our hearts are full of unbeliefe, impenitency, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hypocriſy, and hardneſſe. The <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>ſonnes of men is full of evill, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3. Our wils are full of contumacy, rebellion, and ſtoutneſſe. And as there is a fulneſſe of ſinne in the
<hi>powers</hi> of our ſoules, ſo alſo in the <hi>members</hi> of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Our <hi>tongues are full of deadly poyſon, Jam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Our eyes full of adultery,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. Nay there is a fulneſſe of ſinne, as in our <hi>natures,</hi> ſo in our <hi>actions and ſervices.</hi> Our almes, prayers, ſermons are full of ſinne. Now one
<hi>depth calleth for another,</hi> one fulneſſe for another. The depth, the fulneſſe of ſinne in us, for a depth, a fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt. The treaſure of ſin, the <hi>treaſure of an evill heart in us, Math.</hi> 12.35. for all the treaſures of wiſdome, and grace in him. The ſtrong man is not overcome, and driven out of the houſe, but by a ſtronger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. The kingdome and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne in us, cannot be overthrowne, but by a King of righteouſneſſe. Our ſoules are ſo beſpotted, as that there is no cleanſing of them, but by the lambe of God, who was without blemiſh, or ſpot. The fulneſſe of ſinne cannot be driven, and chaſed out of our ſoules, but by Chriſt, in whom there was a greater fulneſſe of grace. And this, though not enough, muſt now ſuffice, for demonſtration of the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and neceſſity of the dwelling of an all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt.</p>

            <p>1. Hereby he was qualified for his <hi>Prieſtly office.</hi> For he was <hi>holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners; and ſuch an high Prieſt became us, Hebr.</hi> 7.26.</p>

               <hi>end, or intent, God anointed him with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes, that the ſcepter of his kingdome might be a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe. That he might love righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and hate iniquity, Heb.</hi> 1.8,9. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.6,7.</p>
            <p>3. All the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge are a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient furniture for execution of his <hi>Propheticall office.</hi> Who ſo meet to be the great Prophet of the Church, as he, that is infallibly true in all that he ſaith? And the Baptiſt aſſerts the perpetuall infallibility of Chriſt's teſtimony from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurableneſſe of his gifts and graces, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. In <hi>ver.</hi> 33. he ſets downe what honour beliefe of Chriſts teſtimony yeelds unto God, to wit, ſubſcription unto, and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his veracity, <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.</hi> And this he proves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his teſtimony is alwayes the teſtimony of God:
<hi>For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God, ver.</hi> 34. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophets did not alwayes ſpeake the words of God, but ſometimes they ſpake out of their owne <hi>private ſpirit,</hi> and not as Prophets, having the ſpirit of prophecy upon them, as is plain in <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. and <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3. But now Chriſt, whom God hath ſent <hi>ſingularly,</hi> and <hi>eminently,</hi> as the chiefe of all his ambaſſadours, ſpeaketh only the words of God, ſo that his teſtimony is <hi>ſimply,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> divine. And of this he aſſigneth the reaſon, ground, or cauſe, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, for <hi>God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence we may be informed, that if Chriſt had lived in theſe our dayes, he would have beene extreamly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all carnall and unregenerate men, who yet carry a very great outward, and ceremonious reſpect unto him, and profeſſe a deep deteſtation of all that had any hand in his murder and crucifying: For there is nothing that they ſo much maligne, as holineſſe; and therefore their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168371:130"/>againſt Chriſt, the moſt holy, would have beene unſpeakable. If but ſome few, and faint, ſome broken raies or beames of grace ſhine in the life of a member of Chriſt, this preſently makes him the <hi>butt</hi> of their malice: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they had converſed with Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, they would have accounted him of all perſons living, the moſt odious. They, that diſguſt the drops of goodneſſe in
<hi>his,</hi> would never have reliſhed the fountaine, and ocean thereof in
<hi>himſelfe.</hi> They looke with envy upon ſtarres of the leaſt magnitude in the Churches firmament; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſunne of righteouſneſſe could not but be a moſt unpleaſing object unto them. They loath the leaſt meaſure of the ſpirit: and therefore what would their abhorrence have been of him, unto whom God gave not the Spirit by meaſure? They contemne, and deride that anoynting, which believers receive from the holy one; and therefore the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurableneſſe of his owne unction would have miniſtred unto them ample matter for their contempt and deriſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this point may ſerve for confutation of a paſſage in the Learned Dr <hi>Hammond</hi> againſt Mr <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> to wit, that Chriſts love of God was capable of farther degrees. That I doe not faſten this tenet wrongfully upon him, will appeare unto any rationall man by his owne words, which I will therefore tranſcribe.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Dr <hi>Hammond, pag.</hi> 222.</bibl>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place he paſſeth to the inforcement of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from what we read concerning Chriſt himſelfe, that he was more intenſe in prayer at one time then another, when yet the lower degree was ſure no ſin; and prepares to make anſwer to it, viz. that Chriſt was above the Law, and did more then the Law required, but men fall ſhort many degrees of what is required. But ſure this anſwer is nothing to the matter now in hand, for the evidencing of which that example of Chriſt was brought by me, viz. that ſincere love is capable of degrees. This was firſt ſhewed in ſeverall men, and in the ſame man at ſever all times, in the ſeverall rankes of Angels, and at laſt in Chriſt himſelfe, more ardent in one act of prayer then in another.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The concluſion which the Dr undertakes to evidence, is,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168371:130"/>that ſincere love is capable of degrees. Now this the example of Chriſt will never prove, unleſſe it inferre, that Chriſts love of God was capable of degrees, more intenſe at one time then at another. If Chriſts greater ardency in one act of prayer, then in another, doth not argue a greater fervency in his love at one time, then another, this argument from Chriſts praying more earneſtly, will never reach the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which it was brought. Indeed in his treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip, p.</hi> 24. he minceth the matter, and ſpeaketh more cautelouſly: <hi>It is poſſible</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the ſame perſon conſtantly to love God above all, and yet to have higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of that love at one time then another. Thus we read of Chriſt himſelfe, Luk.</hi> 22.24.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of this we may ſay, as he doth of Mr <hi>Cawdrey's</hi> anſwer: It is nothing to the matter now in hand. Becauſe there may be a
<hi>graduall</hi> difference in the expreſſions of the ſame love, for degree. Chriſts death for us was a higher expreſſion of his love of us, then his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hunger, thirſt, &amp;c. and yet they might proceed from a love equally intenſe.</p>
            <p>His Argument then (you ſee) from Chriſts example, will not ſerve his turne, unleſſe it conclude a greater intenſion in his love of God at one time, then at another. And the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſuch an aſſertion is evident from the point here handled, and confirmed, the
<hi>abſolute fulneſſe of Chriſts grace,</hi> which by the generall conſent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen</hi> was ſuch, as that it excluded all <hi>intenſive growth.</hi> It was a <hi>ſequele</hi> of the perſonall union; and therefore it was from the very firſt moment of his conception. The Word was no ſooner made fleſh, but it was forthwith full of grace, &amp; truth. His love of God was uncapable of farther degrees; unto whom God gave not the ſpirit, that is, the gifts, and graces of the ſpirit, by meaſure. But unto Chriſt God gave not the ſpirit; that is, the gifts &amp; graces of the Spirit, by meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. therefore his love of God was not capable of farther degrees. There have beene
<hi>ſome,</hi> that here by <hi>Spirit</hi> have underſtood the
<hi>Godhead</hi> of Chriſt, which was given unto him, as Sonne, by
<hi>eternall generation,</hi> as man, by the <hi>Hypoſtaticall union.</hi> But whether the <hi>Doctor</hi> will imbrace either of theſe expoſitions, I
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:168371:131"/>cannot divine. Indeed many learned men have thought, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt may ſignifie his Godhead, in diſtinction from, or oppoſition unto either his <hi>fleſh, Rom.</hi> 3.4. 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. or <hi>blood, Heb.</hi> 9.14. yet that ſtanding
<hi>ſingle, and abſolutely by it ſelfe, without ſuch compariſon,</hi> it ſhould have any ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in Scripture, can never, I am very confident, be made good by the <hi>Doctor;</hi> and therefore I ſhall acquieſce in the common interpretation, which giveth an utter and totall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow unto the <hi>Doctors</hi> opinion. Unto it alſo the
<hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are generally oppoſite, as will ſoone be confeſſed by thoſe that will peruſe ſuch of them as comment in <hi>tertiam part. Summae Aquinatis quaeſt.</hi> 7. <hi>art.</hi> 12. and <hi>in tert. lib. ſentent. diſtinct.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scotiſts</hi> thinke, that in grace, and conſequently in the love of God, there is a <hi>maximum quod ſic, impertranſibile per divinam potentiam abſolutam:</hi> and then they conceive, that there is a great condecency in the cloathing, dignifying, or beautifying of Chriſts humanity therewith. Becauſe of all other creatures, it was moſt ſtraitly &amp; nearly conjoyned with the Deity, the author of grace, &amp; alſo for that it was by God deſigned to be the univerſall principle, and fountaine of grace unto all the Saints, that ever were, are, or ſhall be in the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> dare not adventure ſo farre herein; but yet <hi>Thomiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotiſts</hi> are unanimous in aſſerting, that the grace of Chriſts humanity was in regard of Gods
<hi>ordinary power,</hi> ever <hi>ſumma,</hi> both
<hi>poſitivè,</hi> and <hi>negativè:</hi> that is, for degrees, it was alwayes at the higheſt, ſo that it could never be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſurmounted. The reaſons of <hi>Aquinas</hi> for this, dilated on at large by his commentatours are <hi>two, ex parte formae, ſcil. ipſius gratiae;</hi> and <hi>ex parte ſubjecti, ſcil. Chriſti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Ex parte formae, ipſius gratiae.</hi> The habituall grace of Chriſt was referred unto the grace of union, as a conſequent ornament of it; and therefore in all congruence it was to be ſuited and proportioned unto it. Now the union of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with the Godhead was the greateſt, that a creature was capable of, and therefore congruent, that the degree of Chriſts habituall grace ſhould be the higheſt, that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God hath allotted unto intellectuall creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:168371:131"/>A <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon is taken <hi>ex parte ipſius ſubjecti, ſcil. Chriſti.</hi> Chriſt was not
<hi>puré viator,</hi> but in his ſoule, he was alſo
<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor,</hi> and that from the firſt inſtant of his Incarnation. He alwayes therefore in his ſoule enjoyed heaven, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the <hi>beatificall viſion:</hi> and therefore all his graces, and conſequently his love of God were <hi>in termino,</hi> and therefore could not admit any further degrees. It is not to be denyed, but that by <hi>ſpeciall diſpenſation</hi> there was ſome reſtraint of the influence of his happineſſe, or beatificall viſion, in the whole courſe of his humiliation, and particularly in the time of his dolefull paſſion. But ſurely it ſeemes very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, and no wayes ſortable unto the ſtate of Chriſts bleſſedneſſe, for his grace and holineſſe, the image of God in him, his love of God, &amp;c. to be liable unto perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and augmentation.</p>
            <p>But let us heare the <hi>Doctors objection,</hi> and conſider of what weight it is. It is taken out of <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>And being in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, he prayed, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, more earneſtly:</hi> that is, he was more ardent in prayer then at other times. And hence he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that his love of God was more fervent then at other times: or elſe this inſtance of Chriſts will not be home unto that, for which it is urged.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer:</hi> 1. The vulgar tranſlation renders
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>prolixiùs:</hi> and if this verſion be good, then there is no place for the <hi>Doctors objection.</hi> But 2. Suppoſe we ſtick unto our owne tranſlation, yet the place may fairly be ſo interpreted, as that it may no wayes advantage the purpoſe of the <hi>Doctor.</hi> For
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>more earneſtly,</hi> may be conſidered in reference unto either the <hi>object,</hi> unto whom he prayed, God; or the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> againſt which he prayed, the evils with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in his agony.</p>
            <p>1. Then he did not in his agony pray <hi>more earneſtly</hi> then at other times, if we conſider his prayer in <hi>reference unto the object,</hi> unto whom it was, God. The Religion, and inward worſhip of his prayer, was for degrees alwaies alike equall. His truſt and dependance upon God, love of, zeale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards God, from which all his prayers flowed, were not at one time more intenſe then at another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:168371:132"/>But now 2. he prayed <hi>more earneſtly</hi> in his agony, then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, in regard of the
<hi>matter,</hi> againſt which he prayed, the evils that he encountred with, which if they were not greater, then thoſe that he deprecated in the former prayer <hi>ver.</hi> 42. yet at leaſt they made a greater impreſſion upon his humane nature: for they put him into a bloudy ſweat. <hi>Being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of bloud, falling downe to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not incurre the diſpleaſure of the
<hi>Doctor</hi> for my boldneſſe in preſuming to examine this paſſage in him. And I profeſſe for mine owne part, that if he will honour me ſo farre, as to reply unto what I have ſaid, his paines ſhall be very welcome unto mee: if he do it (as I am confident he will) in a faire and Scholaſticall way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the dwelling of all-fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt will yeeld <hi>abundant</hi> and <hi>unutterable conſolation</hi> unto all thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt, all his true and ſincere mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And here that this point may ſhed the greater and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger comfort unto all their hearts, I ſhall 1. Demonſtrate, that upon union with the perſon of Chriſt there enſueth 1. A <hi>communion in.</hi> 2. a
<hi>conformity unto</hi> his fulneſſe of grace: and this being made good, I ſhall in the next place ſhew, how that Chriſts members may reap hence a double comfort. 1. <hi>Againſt the ſtrength and fulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> 2. <hi>Againſt their wants in, and emptineſſe of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt thing to be done, is to prove, that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt ſhall enjoy <hi>communion</hi> in, and
<hi>conformity</hi> unto the fulneſſe of Chriſts grace.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>communion</hi> in it, by <hi>imputation</hi> of it unto them; that is, <hi>acceptation</hi> of it for them. And hence is it, that Paul ſpeaking in the name of all believers, ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt of God is made unto us wiſdome and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. What God <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. ſpeakes of the Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, is applicable unto the Church in generall. <hi>Thy beauty was perfect through my comelineſſe, which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Now one branch of that comelineſſe with which God inveſts the Church, and all her true members, is the beauty of habituall holineſſe in Chriſt. The beſt of ſaints<pb n="263" facs="tcp:168371:132"/>conſidered in themſelves, are in great part naked, and thoſe garments that they have of inherent righteouſneſſe, are but as <hi>filthy, or menſtrous rags, Iſ.</hi> 64.6. But now here is their comfort; they have an husband, that hath a full wardrobe of graces, wherewith he can adorne and beautify them from top to toe, wherewith he can cover all their raggs, and nakedneſſe. For the ſake of Chriſts ſpotleſſe holineſſe, every ſoule eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto Chriſt is accepted as gratiouſly, as if ſo be ſhe were in her ſelfe without ſpot. <hi>Thou art all faire, my love</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Church) <hi>there is no ſpot in thee, Cant.</hi> 4.7. that is, as by
<hi>remiſſion,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>by acceptation.</hi> The
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> were to be applied unto the
<hi>twelve</hi> names of the tribes of Iſrael, engraven in the breaſt-plate of the high prieſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.30. And this might be to typifie the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe lights, and perfections, that were in the heart of Chriſt unto all his people: and therefore it is termed (thinke ſome) in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>jus filiorum Iſraelis, the judgment of the people of Iſrael;</hi> that is, that, by which they were to be juſtified in the judgment of God. There is darkneſſe in our light, imperfection in our purity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an utter unaptneſſe and diſability for our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But now upon the heart of our high Prieſt, there is the Urim and the Thummim, lights and perfections, a fulneſſe of knowledge, and a perfection of all other gracious endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which can ſtand before the utmoſt ſeverity of law and juſtice. But now this that we have ſaid, touching the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt unto us, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>cum grano ſalis.</hi> We muſt not divide this fulneſſe of grace from the other parts of Chriſts humiliation, but take them all joyntly, and together. Thus <hi>Pareus</hi> upon <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.10.
<hi>Effectum aeternae ſalutis noſtrae Apoſtolus oſtendit profluere non ex aliqua parte actionum vel paſſionum Chriſti: ſed ex toto redemptionis opere pleniſſimè ab eo peracto. Ne igitur dividamus Chriſtum, aut fidem noſtram diſtrahamus, quaerendo aliam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae partem in nativitate, aliam in habituali ſanctitate, aliam in vitae integritate, aliam in mortis obedientia: oportuit haec omnia in Chriſto compleri, omnibúſque his conſummatis ſalutis aeternae
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:168371:133"/>author nobis extitit.</hi> Of theſe words, that which Mr <hi>Dickſon</hi> hath on the ſame place may ſerve inſtead of a tranſlation. <hi>The proper cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of our ſalvation, is to be ſought in Chriſt, perfected by ſuffering, not in any one part of his holineſſe, or obedience in doing, or any part of his ſuffering, but in him perfected by his obedience; even to the death of the croſſe. We may take comfort from, and make uſe of, his holy conception, life, and ſeverall vertues: But we muſt remember, that his accompliſhed obedience, in doing and ſuffering, is our ranſome, joyntly conſidered, and not any particular act looked on alone.</hi> With theſe <hi>two Dr. Ames</hi> alſo accords.
<hi>Med. Theol. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. §. 27. <hi>Haec juſtitia non eſt membratim quaerenda in puritate naturae, nativitatis, &amp; vitae Chriſti: ſed ex totâ Chriſti obedientiâ exurgit ſimul cum remiſſione peccatorum ſicut eadem Adami inobedientia &amp; ſpoliavit nos juſtitiâ originali, &amp; obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ios etiam reddidit reatui condemnationis.</hi> This righteouſneſſe, which muſt come in place of juſtification, is not ſeverally to be ſought in the purity of the nature, birth, and life of Chriſt: but it ariſeth out of all the obedience of Chriſt, together with remiſſion of ſins, as the ſame diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> hath both robbed us of Originall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and made us ſubject to the guilt of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place, I am to cleare, that in all the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, there ſhall be a <hi>conformitie</hi> unto his fulneſſe of grace. God hath predeſtinated them thereunto <hi>Rom.</hi>
8.29. and how great a congruence there is therein, will ſoone appeare, if we compare Chriſt with Adam: <hi>For as we have borne the image of the earthy, the firſt man, we ſhall alſo beare the image of the heavenly,</hi> the
<hi>ſecond man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. The firſt Adam was not only full of ſinne in himſelfe, but he alſo filled all his poſterity with ſinne, and death. And ſhall not the ſecond Adam then fill all his off-ſpring with grace, and life. Unto them the firſt Adam was a Channell of ſin, and corruption: And Therefore the ſecond Adam ſhall be unto them a fountain of grace, and ſanctification: For is not he as powerfull to communicate this, as the other was to inſtill that. And beſides, he is as willing to<pb n="265" facs="tcp:168371:133"/>doe it, as he is able: For he hath in a plentifull meaſure <hi>ſhed</hi> his blood <hi>for his Church,</hi> much more will he plentifully <hi>ſhed</hi> and derive his Spirit <hi>upon her.</hi> Queſtionleſſe, he will be as liberall of his grace, as blood; powre out one, as well as the other.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> having <hi>chap.</hi> 11.
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. foretold, how that there ſhould deſcend upon Chriſt, even the fountaine of all knowledge, <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell and knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> in
<hi>ver.</hi> 9. he ſubjoyneth the plentifull communication, or overflowing of this fountain unto the Church. <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea:</hi> that is, the channell, or bottome of the Sea. The Church, and her true members ſhall be as full of the knowledge of God, as the ſea is full of waters. That from this endowing of Chriſt with all-fulneſſe of grace, and ſpirit, all that belong unto him have ground of comfort, and wherein, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> plainly intimateth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.7. where he calleth the ſpirit, wherewith Chriſt was anointed, <hi>the oyle of gladneſſe.</hi> And the
<hi>oyle of gladneſſe</hi> it is called, not onely becauſe in
<hi>reflexion</hi> on it his owne ſoule was filled with joy, peace, and comfort, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it <hi>gladdeth the hearts</hi> of all his choſen people. He <hi>was anointed to appoint unto them, that mourne in Sion, the oyle of joy for mourning, Eſay</hi> 61.1,3. Now his unction gladdeth, and cheareth the hearts of all his members: Becauſe of the oyle, wherewith he was anointed, there is alſo an effuſion upon them. The <hi>excellency</hi> of his unction above his members im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth their <hi>communion</hi> with him therein. The <hi>compariſon of inequality, He was anointed above his fellows,</hi> preſuppoſeth a <hi>compariſon of ſimilitude,</hi> to wit, that his fellowes were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too, though in a farre inferiour meaſure. But now they be onely members, and not excrements, that are the objects of this effuſion. They be the <hi>fellowes</hi> of Chriſt, that ſhare with him in this his anointing. He is anointed above his fellowes; and what
<hi>fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe, What communion hath light with darkneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. How can they that are filled with all unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. be the fellowes of the Sonne, and King of righteouſneſſs!

               <hi>diſtribution</hi> Chriſt makes of grace unto his Church, and there be 4 <hi>particulars,</hi> by which he illuſtrates it, 1. the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality,</hi> 2. <hi>The variety, diverſity,</hi> or <hi>inequality,</hi> 3. The <hi>limitation,</hi> 4. The
<hi>freeneſſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. It is <hi>common,</hi> and <hi>univerſall: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one of us grace is given:</hi> not unto every <hi>man,</hi> but unto every
<hi>believer,</hi> unto every true member of Chriſt, and his Church.</p>
            <p>2. This <hi>diſtribution</hi> is with great <hi>diverſity</hi> and <hi>inequality.</hi> Thus <hi>Cornel. Alapide</hi> comments upon it,
<hi>Cuique data eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>gratia non una &amp; par, ſed varia, &amp; diſpar: huic major, illi minor.</hi> Unto every one of us are given ſeverall graces. We have not the ſame <hi>degrees,</hi> if we ſpeake of the <hi>graces of ſanctification:</hi> We have not the ſame
<hi>ſorts</hi> or <hi>kinds,</hi> if we ſpeake of <hi>the graces of edification.</hi> There is great variety, both in the quantity, and quality of the talents, or gifts of the ſervants of Chriſt: One may have
<hi>five,</hi> another but <hi>two talents.</hi> The talents of the one may be of gold; the talents of the other but of ſilver.</p>
            <p>3. We have the <hi>limitation,</hi> that is obſerved in this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of grace. Unto every one of us Grace is given <hi>by meaſure.</hi> The beſt of us have but our meaſure, a ſmall, and narrow ſcantling. For an abſolute fulneſſe is the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable property of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, Here is the <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of this diſtribution: Unto every one of us grace is freely <hi>given,</hi> not
<hi>ſold.</hi> The diverſity, that is in the meaſure of mens gifts, and graces, proceedeth not from any inequality in their merits, or foregoing prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but meerely from the free grace, the gift, the good will, and pleaſure of Chriſt. <hi>Grace is given unto us according unto the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps ſeeme that this place is not ſo pertinently alleadged, becauſe it ſpeakes only of a meaſure in the grace of the ſaints, and ſo aſſerts not a conformitie unto the fulneſſe thereof in Chriſt. But in the leaſt meaſure of ſincere grace there is a kind of fulneſſe, <hi>Plenitudo reſpectiva, &amp; ſecundum quid.</hi> And that Chriſt communicateth ſuch a fulneſſe unto his Church, I ſhall farther confirme, 1. From <hi>it's relation unto Chriſt.</hi> 2 from <hi>Gods end,</hi> in the collation of all fulneſſe of<pb n="269" facs="tcp:168371:136"/>grace upon Chriſt, 3. By going over the <hi>ſeverall gradations</hi> of the fulneſſe of grace, that Chriſt imparts unto her in this life.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>relation</hi> of the Church unto Chriſt. She is related unto him, as a <hi>ſpouſe</hi> unto her husband, as <hi>a houſe</hi> unto the Lord or Proprietary, as <hi>a body</hi> unto the head.</p>
            <p>1. As <hi>a wife, or ſpouſe</hi> unto her husband,
<hi>Canticl.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23,25,29,30,31. In him, the husband, there are hid unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of grace, and wiſedome: And will he then ſuffer her, whom he hath taken ſo neare unto himſelfe, to want, to be poore in grace. He hath grace, as a <hi>treaſurer,</hi> and can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of it to whom he will. May not ſhee, who is as it were the wife of his boſome freely begge it of him? The garments of holineſſe are all in his cuſtody, and at his diſpoſall: Can his tender heart then poſſibly endure to ſee her goe naked, and in rags? Chriſt was a lambe
<hi>abſolutely</hi> without ſpot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. and therefore he will not ſuffer any raigning or unmortified ſpot in his love. <hi>Thou art all faire</hi> (ſaith he himſelfe unto her) <hi>and there is no ſpot in thee, Cant.</hi> 4.7. that is, (if we underſtand the words of
<hi>ſanctification</hi>) <hi>comparatively,</hi> in compariſon of the wicked and unregenerate, who are all over defiled, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. and ſpotted with the world, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27.</p>
            <p>2. The Church is related unto Chriſt, <hi>as a houſe unto</hi> the Lord, or proprietary. <hi>Chriſt was faithfull, as a ſonne over his houſe, whoſe houſe are we, Heb.</hi> 3.6. Now did he of old fill his materiall houſe, the Temple, with his preſence and glory, and will he not now fill his ſpirituall houſe with his ſpirit, and grace? undoubtedly he will. As the cloud of Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence firſt filled the Sanctuary, and afterwards the whole temple: Even ſo the ſpirit of grace in Chriſt ſhall firſt fill the ſoule in believers, and it's faculties, and then ſpread it ſelfe over the body, ſo that that ſhall be become an outward temple of the holy Ghoſt. It is ſaid of the oyntment, wherewith Mary anointed the feet of Chriſt, that the whole houſe was filled with the odour of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.3. Semblably may we ſay of the ſpirit and grace, wherewith Chriſt was anointed, that his whole houſe, to wit, Church, is filled with the fruits and comforts of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:168371:137"/>3. She is related unto him, as the body unto the head. The Church, which is his body. The <hi>fulneſſe of him, that filleth all in all, Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. In which words we have as the
<hi>relation</hi> of the Church unto Chriſt, ſo alſo the <hi>influence of</hi> Chriſt upon the Church.</p>
            <p>1. We have here the <hi>relation of the</hi> Church unto Chriſt: She is his body, and hereupon his fulneſſe. The name of fulneſſe is (as
<hi>Rollocke</hi> thinks) a declaration of the relation of body from it's office, which is to compleat, and in an externall way to perfect the head: For the members are a ſuperadded ornament unto the head, and an object of it's influence. So that though it were in it ſelfe never ſo comely, yet it would, ſever'd from them, be defective, nay looſe the very nature and relation of head, as having nothing whereon to exerciſe its office. So though Chriſt conſidered <hi>perſonally</hi> be poſſeſt with an overflowing fulneſſe, yet if we conſider him <hi>myſtically,</hi> as head of his Church, ſuch is his love unto his Church, as that he eſteemeth himſelfe but maimed, and imperfect, unleſſe he have her joyned unto him, as his body. By this then, we ſee, that Chriſts <hi>own intereſt</hi> will lie upon him, as an engagement to be carefull for the filling of his Church, and every member thereof, with all requiſite graces: for becauſe ſhe is his fulneſſe, therefore by filling her, he himſelfe under the
<hi>capacity and notion of head,</hi> becommeth the more full; His glory and honour is the more advanced, His joy and comfort the more enlarged. The more gracious his members are, the more joyfull and glorious he is.</p>
            <p>But this engagement of Chriſt unto his Church, as his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fulneſſe, we have made good by the <hi>ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in the text, <hi>Chriſts influence upon</hi> the Church, <hi>who filleth all in all:</hi> that is, who filleth all things, to wit, all <hi>powers</hi> and
<hi>parts,</hi> in all <hi>Saints,</hi> in all his <hi>members.</hi> He filleth their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings</hi> with a ſaving light; their <hi>wills</hi> with holy, and heavenly purpoſes and intentions, deſires and affections: their <hi>conſciences</hi> with peace and purity: their bodies with promptneſſe and readineſſe of obedience unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and their ſoules.</p>
            <p>There be <hi>ſome</hi> that differ from us in the

               </gap>, <hi>paſſively,</hi> and ſo read the words thus: The Church is the fulneſſe of him, who is filled all in all. As the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in common, and generall, is the fulneſſe of Chriſt: ſo every true member of the Church is a part, and portion of that fulneſſe: and therefore however Chriſt, as head, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abſolutely compleat, untill all his elect members are gathered, and fully united unto him joyntly, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, all at once in the reſurrection, in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as well as ſoules; Yet he may be ſaid to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>inchoatively,</hi> and <hi>gradually,</hi> in the ſucceſſive vocation, Sanctification, and glorification of his ſeverall members. The union betweene Chriſt and the Church is ſo neare, as that Chriſt is ſometimes taken <hi>collectively,</hi> for the whole Church conſiſting of head, and body. And hereupon, what is done and ſuffered by the Church, is frequently aſcribed unto Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.

            <p>A ſecond particular I propounded, was Gods end in conferring an allfulneſſe of grace upon Chriſt. It was to fit, and enable him to be a vitall, and univerſall principle of grace, and holineſſe unto his Church. He had it then, not as a <hi>private,</hi> but as <hi>a publique perſon, as a ſecond Adam,</hi> as the <hi>head</hi> of his Church. And the head (we know) is an <hi>officiall part</hi> in the body, having ſenſe and motion, not for it ſelfe onely, but for the whole body. Even after the ſame manner that the ſtomacke hath meat's, the liver bloud; even ſo Chriſts grace was not for himſelfe, but for his members. If you will compare <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.18. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. The <hi>compariſon</hi> will light you unto this

            <p>2. Chriſts habituall grace therefore is onely a <hi>morall,</hi> or <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of ours, And that</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Remotely;</hi> becauſe it is a qualification prerequiſite unto all the ſatisfaction, and merit of his obedience. For no part of his obedience, either <hi>active,</hi> or <hi>paſſive,</hi> would have been in the leaſt degree, either ſatisfactory, or meritorious, if it had not proceeded from a nature, endowed with an all-fulneſſe of grace, and a moſt ſpotleſſe holineſſe.</p>
            <p>2. Say others, <hi>proximè;</hi> becauſe it merited the grace, and holineſſe of all his members: For every branch of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was meritorious. And was it not a part of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that he, who in regard of his divine, and infinite perſon was above the law, the Law-giver, ſhould aſſume a nature, that ſhould be all over cloathed with habituall conformity unto the law, ſhould be made under the Law, not onely actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but habitually?</p>
            <p>Againſt this it is uſually <hi>objected,</hi> that Chriſt, as man, as a<pb n="274" facs="tcp:168371:139"/>reaſonable creature, was obliged unto the habituall grace, or holineſſe of his nature, <hi>as touching the continuance of it;</hi> and therefore it could be no part of his debt, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke, as our mediatour: what he owed for himſelfe, he could not be bound unto for us.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwer:</hi> I ſhall apply to the habituall grace of Chriſt, what <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Med. Theol. lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>cap.</hi> 21. §. 24. touching his legall obedience. <hi>Although it was required of Chriſt, now made man, by right of creation, yet becauſe he was made man, not for himſelfe, but for us, it was a part of that humiliation, ſatisfaction, and merit, which God required, and accepted of him for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, that I have ſaid, you may qualify divers paſſages in ſome <hi>practicall Divines</hi> of great note &amp; ability, concerning the influence of Chriſts fulneſſe of grace. I ſhall give you the ſumme of what they ſay, deſiring you to underſtand them of a
<hi>morall,</hi> or <hi>meritorious cauſality.</hi> Chriſt had fulneſſe of grace, as the <hi>ſunne hath light;</hi> a <hi>fountaine waters;</hi> a
<hi>depoſitarie treaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As the <hi>ſunne</hi> hath light: He was the <hi>ſunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> And the ſunne was endowed with a fulneſſe of light, not ſo much for its own proper ornament, as for the good of the whole univerſe, to diſpenſe abroad a rich warmth, and influence upon it. Even ſo the ſunne of righteouſneſſe was inriched with an all-fulneſſe of grace, not onely for his own proper, and perſonall perfection, but alſo for the benefit, and behoofe of his members, that he might communicate thereof unto them, and make them likewiſe full of grace.</p>
            <p>2. As a <hi>fountain</hi> hath waters. A <hi>fountain</hi> of
<hi>gardens, A well of living waters, Canticl.</hi> 4.15. Now wherefore is a fountaine, but to repleniſh ſtreames, and rivers? To what purpoſe ſerveth a fountaine in a garden, but to water the plants, hearbs, and flowers therein, which would otherwiſe waxe dry, and wither. <hi>He filleth all things with his wiſedome as Phyſon, and as Tigris in the time of the New fruits. He maketh the underſtanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harveſt:</hi> At which time it overfloweth all its bankes.
<hi>I alſo came out as a brooke from a river, and as a<pb n="275" facs="tcp:168371:139"/>conduit into a garden. I ſaid,</hi> I <hi>will water my beſt garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: Eccleſiaſticus</hi>
24.25,26,30,31.</p>
            <p>3. As a <hi>depoſitary</hi> hath treaſures: <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of knowledge and wiſedome.</hi> He had knowledge, and wiſedome, as a publick officer, and <hi>treaſurer thereof.</hi> And he was not appointed a treaſurer niggardly, to hoard it up. When a man hath riches, it is a <hi>vanity under the ſunne</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>to keep them and hoard them up.</hi> He were as good not to have them, as not to uſe them.
<hi>Wiſedome that is hid, and treaſure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both? Eccleſ.</hi> 20.3. But he was ſealed, and ſanctified to be a liberall diſpenſer of them, unto thoſe whom his father had given him amongſt men. As all the granaries of corne in <hi>Egypt</hi> were by
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for the ſupply, not of
<hi>Ioſephs,</hi> but of the peoples publick wants. <hi>Ille frumenta ſervavit non ſibi, ſed omni populo. As Bernard</hi> in his ſecond
<hi>Homily Super miſſus eſt.</hi> Even ſo was Chriſt entruſted with all treaſures of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and knowledg, not ſo much for his own, as for the Churches uſe.</p>
            <p>And thus, you ſee, how that Chriſt received this fulneſſe, even for this very purpoſe to diſtribute of it unto his Church. His fulneſſe was, not onely a fulneſſe of <hi>ſufficiency for</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but alſo a fulneſſe of <hi>redundancy, influence, and efficiency</hi> upon others.</p>
            <p>Now the ſoule of a Chriſtian may from the premiſes, to its unſpeakabe comfort, frame this, or the like diſcourſe. Dwelleth there an all-fulneſſe of grace in my Saviour, and can there be an emptineſſe in me? Was this fulneſſe of grace beſtowed upon him, not ſo much for himſelfe, as for others, for me amongſt the reſt, and will not he employ it for my good? Will not he derive part of it unto me? So ſhould he betray that truſt, which his father hath repoſed in him, as <hi>Lordetreaſurer of his</hi> Church, which, but to imagine, were blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. Fulneſſe of grace was conferred upon him, as the head of his Church; How can it then but have a powerfull (that I ſay not) unreſiſtable influence upon me, who am one of his members? Unnaturall were it for the head of the<pb n="276" facs="tcp:168371:140"/>naturall body to keep in the ſpirit, ſence, and motion, and not conveigh them unto the reſt of the body. As unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as unbecoming were it for the head of the body <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> not to impart grace unto the reſt of the members.</p>
            <p>In the third, and laſt place, I ſhall goe over the ſeverall
<hi>gradations</hi> of the fulneſſe of grace, that Chriſt imparts unto his Church and members here in this life.</p>
            <p>1. He communicateth unto all his members an <hi>initiall fulneſſe</hi> of grace, a <hi>fulneſſe of parts</hi> in their firſt converſion.</p>
            <p>2. Unto thoſe, that are of full age, and ſtrong in the faith, he diſtributes a <hi>progreſſive fulneſſe,</hi> (as I may call it) which accreweth unto them upon the further growth of their holineſſe.</p>
            <p>1. Then he communicates unto all his members an <hi>initiall fulneſſe</hi> of grace, a <hi>fulneſſe of parts</hi> unto all his members in their firſt converſion. <hi>In the waſhing of regeneration, and in our renewing, the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Tit.</hi> 3.5,6. The vocation or converſion of the Gentiles is termed by the ſame Apoſtle,
<hi>Ro.</hi> 11.12. <hi>their riches,</hi> becauſe therein the riches, that is, a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaſure of Gods grace is by the ſpirit of Chriſt powred on them. It is alſo called in the ſame place, <hi>the riches of the world,</hi> becauſe thereby ſome of all nations diſperſed through out the whole world, are inriched with gratious endowments from the ſpirit of Chriſt. <hi>Of his fulneſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt)
<hi>have all we received, and grace for grace, John.</hi> 1.16. In which words we have 1. A <hi>deduction or derivation of our</hi> grace from the fulneſſe thereof in Chriſt, as a fountaine. 2. An exact
<hi>conformitie,</hi> &amp; anſwerableneſſe of our grace unto the fulneſſe thereof in Chriſt, as unto its <hi>rule, and patterne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We have a <hi>deduction or derivation of our</hi> grace from the fulneſſe thereof in Chriſt, as a <hi>fountaine. Of his fulneſſe we receive grace:</hi> Even as the glaſſe doth the Image from the face. The fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt is not onely a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of an
<hi>abundance,</hi> but alſo a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>redundance.</hi> From his fulneſſe there runneth over a ſhare, and portion unto his Church: Even as light is derived from the ſunne unto the beames iſſuing from it; As ſap goeth from the roote<pb n="277" facs="tcp:168371:140"/>unto the branches; As water floweth from the fountaine unto the ſtreames; As ſence and motion deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the head unto the members. I find in ſome papers, that I collected when I was firſt a Student in Divinity in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and if my memory faile me not, it was ſomewhere in <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that the prepoſition [<hi>of</hi>] denoteth <hi>three</hi> things. 1. the
<hi>Originall,</hi> or efficient cauſe of our grace. 2. <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality of the principle, or efficient cauſe</hi> of Chriſts grace and ours. Thus the Sonne is ſaid to be <hi>of</hi> the Father. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto this acception of the particle, the fulneſſe of Chriſt is the holy Ghoſt, who proceedeth from him conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall to him in nature, vertue, and majeſtie. For although the habituall endowments of his ſoule, are different in number from thoſe in us, yet it is one, and the ſame ſpirit, that filled him, and ſanctifieth us, <hi>All theſe worketh that one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, of,</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>partiality,</hi> or
<hi>imperfection</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of our grace from Chriſt. We
<hi>receive of his fulneſſe, and not his fulneſſe it ſelfe.</hi> And thus we uſually ſay, take, and receive of this bread &amp; wine, when we mean only a part of the bread or wine, &amp; not the whole. There is a perfect fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt, but how little a part, or portion thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth unto us! <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one of us grace is given according unto the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>2. Here is an <hi>exact conformity,</hi> and
<hi>anſwerableneſſe</hi> of our grace, unto the fulneſſe thereof in Chriſt, as unto it's rule, and patterne. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace,</hi>

            <p>2. Chriſt communicateth unto ſuch of his members, as are of full age, and ſtrong in the faith, a <hi>progreſſive fulneſſe of grace:</hi> and I terme it ſo, becauſe it accreweth unto them upon their proficiency in grace, and holineſſe. Now that this <hi>progreſſive fulneſſe</hi> is attainable here in this life may be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, From the
<hi>commendations that are given in Scripture</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints for it; from <hi>the exhortations to it;</hi> from the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, promiſes, and relations of it;</hi> from the <hi>prayers, both of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and thanksgiving for it,</hi> that occurre in Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>From the commendations that are given in Scripture unto the Saints for it,</hi> as unto <hi>Elizabeth, Luk.</hi> 1.41. <hi>Zacharias, v.</hi> 67. <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 6.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.55. <hi>Dorcas, Act.</hi> 9.36. and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 11.24. one part of the character of the Angell of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> is, that notwithſtanding his outward poverty, he <hi>was yet rich, Rev.</hi> 2.9. <hi>to wit; inwardly towards God, Luk.</hi> 12.21. with <hi>true riches, Luk.</hi> 16.11.

            <p>

And ſuch a fulneſſe is conferred upon even the weakeſt in the faith, and that at their firſt converſion: for then they have ſo much grace, as doth in ſome meaſure enable them, for the mortifying of every luſt, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all duties, whether of the firſt or ſecond Table.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>ſecond</hi> place, there is a fulneſſe of

               </gap>, unto wickedneſſe; ſo that it comprehendeth all vertuous and gracious habits whatſoever.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>All knowledge;</hi> that is, the knowledge of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto faith, godlineſſe, and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>3. Laſtly, we have the reſult or ſequel of this fulneſſe, Qualification of them for the duty of mutual admonition, unto which is requiſite a <hi>gracious heart,</hi> and a <hi>gifted head:</hi> Becauſe they <hi>were full of goodneſſe,</hi> they had hearts propenſe unto ſo good a worke: Becauſe they were <hi>filled with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> they were able to mannage it for the beſt advantage unto Gods glory, and their owne edification. <hi>The foure beaſts were full of eyes before, behind, and within, Rev.</hi> 4.6,8. that is, the miniſters of the Goſpell, comprehended under the foure Evangeliſts, were full of knowledge and vigilant care. They were full of eyes <hi>before,</hi> to looke towards God; and <hi>behind,</hi> to looke towards their people; and
<hi>within,</hi> to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument for the attainableneſſe of this progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168371:142"/>fulneſſe, is the
<hi>exhortations,</hi> that occurre in ſcripture unto it. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be <hi>perfect,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.
<hi>to perfect holineſſe in the feare of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7.1. <hi>and to be abounding in the worke of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.58. <hi>The Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians to abound in faith, Col.</hi> 2.7. the
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> to goe <hi>on unto perfection,</hi> Heb. 6.1. He beſeecheth the <hi>Theſſalonians by the Lord Jeſus to abound more and more,</hi> to wit, in ſpirituals; that is, in graces and duties.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are <hi>Prophecies</hi> of this progreſſive fulneſſe in the old Teſtament, <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.5. <hi>The Lord is exalted.</hi> Chriſt is riſen, and aſcended into heaven: <hi>for he dwelleth on high;</hi> that is, he ſitteth at the right hand of the Father. And the fruit hereof is the filling of the Church with grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>He hath filled Sion with judgement and righteouſneſſe. The ſpirit ſhall be powred upon us from on high: And the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall be a fruitfull field, Iſaiah</hi> 32.15. <hi>The deſert ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and bloſſome as the Roſe. It ſhall bloſſome abundantly: the glory of Lebanon ſhall be given unto it, The excellency of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and Sharon, Eſay</hi> 35.1,2.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Argument is the promiſe that is made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this progreſſive fulneſſe. <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour propounds this <hi>promiſe twice.</hi> 1. <hi>In the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the ſower,</hi> unto the having or poſſeſſion of grace,
<hi>Math.</hi> 13.12. 2. <hi>In the parable of the talents,</hi> unto the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of grace.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the parable of the ſower,</hi> unto the having or poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace; and then the words may be thus paraphraſed. Whoſoever hath the <hi>initials</hi> of ſanctifying, and ſaving grace, the beginnings of faith and repentance, unto him ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven increaſe thereof, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. and this increaſe ſhall not be ſparing, but very plentifull. And <hi>he ſhall have more abundance.</hi> The good ground, the honeſt and believing heart, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the word, and underſtandeth it, <hi>beareth fruit, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty, Math.</hi> 13.23. a ſparke ſhall grow to be a flame: That light which at firſt was but as the dawning, ſhall at laſt ſhine more &amp; more unto the perfect day. <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him</hi> (ſaith our<pb n="281" facs="tcp:168371:142"/>Saviour) <hi>the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, John</hi> 15.5. And the reaſon hereof, wee may fetch from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe of the ſame chapter, <hi>Every branch that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruit the father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi>

               <hi>Arminians</hi> will not allow this promiſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto the <hi>elect</hi> and the regenerate, but would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it unto the <hi>generalitie of mankind,</hi> unto even the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, unto whom the ſound of the Goſpell never came. But this our reſtraint of the words I ſhall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy out of our <hi>renowned Twiſſe Vindic. grat. lib.</hi>
3. <hi>pag.</hi> 140, 141, 142. by three arguments, firſt, from the
<hi>caution premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, verſ.</hi> 9. ſecondly, from the <hi>words immediatly foregoing, verſ.</hi> 11. of which they are a
<hi>confirmation,</hi> 3. <hi>From the words following,</hi> which are an
<hi>illuſtration of them</hi> by way of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis or oppoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the caution premiſed, verſ. 9. <hi>who hath eares to heare let him heare.</hi> Where by eares is meant the inward eare of faith, and ſpirituall underſtanding. Now that they who have eares to <hi>heare</hi> are the ſame with our Saviours, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe <hi>that have,</hi> will eaſily appeare to him, that ſhall compare the 9, 10, 11, 12. verſes togeather.</p>
            <p>2. From the words immediatly foregoing, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>unto you it is given to know the myſteries of the kingdome of heaven, &amp;c. for whoſoever hath, unto him ſhall be given, &amp;c.</hi> Now here would be no proofe at all, unleſſe by <hi>thoſe that have,</hi> be meant ſuch as reſemble the Apoſtle in piety, and holineſſe, unleſſe they be as they, elect and regenerate.</p>
            <p>3. From the <hi>following words,</hi> which are of them an
<hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration,</hi> by way of <hi>Antitheſis, or oppoſition. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that he hath.</hi> Hence I thus argue. By <hi>thoſe that have not,</hi> are underſtood the unregenerate, and therefore by <hi>thoſe that have,</hi> are meant the regenerate. That by <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath not,</hi> are underſtood the unregenerate, is evident, becauſe theſe words, <hi>whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath,</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:168371:143"/>are urged by our Saviour as an Argument to prove that clauſe in the precedent verſe: But <hi>unto them it is not given.</hi> Which in <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.11. is thus varied. <hi>But unto them that are without, all theſe things are done in parables.</hi> Now by ſuch <hi>as are without,</hi> our Saviour underſtands Aliens, ſuch as are not inwardly, and effectually called, ſuch as are not members of the Church in regard of <hi>ſpirituall communion;</hi> However they may have place therein, in regard of <hi>outward profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This engagement of our Saviour is made, 2. in the <hi>parable of the Talents,</hi> unto the diligent, faithfull, and holy uſe of the gifts, and graces, both of edification, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.29. And then it may be thus gloſſed. Whoſoever uſeth his gifts, and talents well, in a ſanctified manner, for his maſters ſervice, the advancement of Gods glory, the promotion of Chriſt's Kingdome, unto him, beſides the reward mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 23, at the laſt day, ſhall be given even here in this life an abundant improvement of theſe gifts, and talents, and the great enlargment of their gracious uſe for the edification of others.</p>
            <p>A 5th argument is from the relations of this progreſſive fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>relation</hi> of an <hi>effect</hi> towards ſpirituall and heavenly wiſedome. The wiſedome that is from above is (ſaith <hi>Jam. chap.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>full of mercy, and good fruites. Full of mercy,</hi> and that <hi>erga egenos, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe that are wanting,</hi> as alſo <hi>erga er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, and peccantes,</hi> thoſe, that are faulty, and ſtraying: and <hi>full of good fruits;</hi> that is, of all offices of humanity, and love, as <hi>Pareus</hi> expounds the words. And if it be full of mercy, and good fruits towards men, it is alſo full of Religion and acts of worſhip towards God: For between the graces and duties of the firſt and ſecond table there is an inſeparable coherence.</p>
            <p>2. From the relation it hath of a <hi>conſequent,</hi> and
<hi>end,</hi> unto Chriſts aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>1. Then it is related unto Chriſts aſcenſion, as the
<hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> thereof. Whereas the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
68.18. mentioning the effect, or fruit of Chriſts aſcenſion in regard
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:168371:143"/>of his members, ſaith, <hi>that he received gifts for men.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in his quotation of this place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. expreſſeth the paſſage thus, He <hi>gave gifts unto men.</hi> Which variation ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as <hi>Fulke</hi> obſerveth in <hi>pag.</hi> 12. of his anſwere to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of <hi>Martin</hi> againſt the Engliſh tranſlations of the bible) wherefore Chriſt received gifts, viz; to beſtow them on his Church.</p>
            <p>To receive, and give, are different actions; But yet, when receiving, or taking, is deſigned unto a farther giving, it is an uſuall
<hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> to expreſſe the latter by the former.</p>
            <p>In the words of the Pſalmiſt, there is (as <hi>Beza, Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerve) an <hi>Ellipſis,</hi> which may be ſupplied thus; Thou having received, gaveſt gifts unto men. So that by a <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> the <hi>Conſequent</hi> is underſtood by the
<hi>Antecedent;</hi> Chriſts receiving of gifts is put for his giving of gifts. Becauſe, as it is noted by <hi>A lapide,</hi> he received them not to keep them unto himſelfe, but to impart, and diſtribute them unto thoſe, whom God hath given him among the ſonnes of men.</p>
            <p>There be <hi>two</hi> things amongſt many others, that diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage poore believers, and make them doubtfull of their ſhares in the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>lowneſſe and meanneſſe</hi> of their condition.
2. The <hi>ſinfulneſſe</hi> and rebellion of their natures and lives.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſalm.</hi> 68.18.
<hi>Thou haſt received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious</hi> alſo, hold forth comfort againſt both theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>1. It comforts againſt the <hi>lowneſſe and meanneſſe of</hi> our condition. Thou haſt received gifts for men
<hi>indefinitely.</hi> Gentiles, as well as Jewes; poore, as well as rich; unlearned as well as learned; deformed, as well as beautifull. No ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe abaſure whatſoever is any bar unto the bounty of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſaith the diſtreſſed conſcience, I am not onely a deſpicable worme, but a ſinfull, and rebellious wretch, and what thoughts of favour can Chriſt have to ſuch an one?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why thou haſt received gifts for men,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>yea, for the rebellious alſo.</hi> Every man is even from the<pb n="284" facs="tcp:168371:144"/>wombe a rebell againſt the command, grace, and ſpirit of God. And therefore the rebellious here are denominated from more then an ordinary height of rebellion, contracted by cuſtome in ſinning, and ſuperadded unto that naturall contumacie, which is common unto all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> No degree of rebellion renders uncapable of benefit, by the fulneſſe of Chriſts gifts, and graces, but what carrieth along finall impenitency with it. Thou <hi>haſt received gifts for the rebellious alſo:</hi> that is, for even the worſt of penitent rebels: ſuch as have beene notorious, and deſperate fighters againſt God, Children of diſobedience, or rebellion, fooliſh, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſerving diverſe luſts, and pleaſures, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. What a plentifull portion of gifts, and graces did Chriſt poure upon <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was in the very ruffe, and greateſt heat of his rebellion, when he breathed out threatnings, and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of the Lord.</p>
            <p>By this you ſee, that one conſequent of Chriſts Aſcenſion, after his victories upon the Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. regarding his favourites, and loving ſubjects, was a diſtribution of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts unto them. As it was the cuſtome of <hi>Generals,</hi> when after a victory in a forraigne warre, they returned in triumph unto their owne country to ſend preſents, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto their friends, and to caſt gifts among the poore multitude, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.26,27. &amp;c.
<hi>Eſther</hi> 9.19,22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38,39. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of the fourth chapter of the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> the Apoſtle affirmeth this communication of gifts unto the Church, to be not a meere <hi>conſequent,</hi> but further, the very
<hi>and</hi> it ſelfe of Chriſts aſcenſion. <hi>He aſcended farre above all heavens, that he might fill all things:</hi> that is, all his members with all graces neceſſary unto them, either in a generall way, as they were members of the Church, or in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar conſideration, if they were officers of the Church. The univerſall particle [<hi>all</hi>] is to be limited by the matter that is for the preſent handled. Now it is manifeſt by the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, that he ſpeakes of the Church, and therefore <hi>all</hi> is to be reſtrained unto the Church, and her members. And of ſuch reſtraints of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:168371:144"/>particle, we have in this Epiſtle, beſides the preſent place, <hi>three</hi> inſtances, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.10,23
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.6, <hi>Beza</hi> thinkes, that the Apoſtle uſeth it here of ſet purpoſe, to ſhew that all difference betweene Jew and Gentile is taken away. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts aſcenſion the heavenly dew of Gods grace fell onely upon the <hi>fleece,</hi> the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but ſince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole earth, upon even the fulneſſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. For Chriſt aſcended farre above all heavens <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he might fill all: that is, to paraphraſe the words by parallel places of Scripture, that he <hi>might poure</hi> his <hi>Spirit upon all fleſh, Joel</hi> 2.28. that the <hi>earth might be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſea, Eſay</hi> 11.9.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> underſtand the words concerning the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute filling of all places with Chriſts manhood. <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Emanuel Sa,</hi> and others thinke, that to <hi>fill all,</hi> is as much, as to
<hi>fulfill all</hi> promiſes, and prophecies, that were written of him in the old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But the interpretation of the words, which I have brought, is favoured, as expoſitours upon the place gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally alleadge, by the ſcope unto which they ſerve for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> by both the words foregoing of which they are an <hi>explication,</hi> and by the words following, which are of them an <hi>exemplification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By the ſcope, not onely of theſe words, but alſo of the whole verſe, nay of the two verſes immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, which is laid downe verſe 7. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one of us grace is given, &amp;c.</hi> Now unto the confirmation of this, that unto every one grace is given by Chriſt, Chriſt's aſcenſion to fill every one, <hi>to fill all,</hi> is very aptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
            <p>2. By the words foregoing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. of which they are an <hi>explication, When he aſcended up on high, &amp;c. hee gave gifts unto men.</hi> To aſcend up on high is to aſcend up farre above all heavens; and to give gifts unto men is to fill all ſorts, and kinds of men with gifts. The Apoſtle ſeemes plainly, thinkes <hi>Beza,</hi> to allude unto the verſe following<pb n="286" facs="tcp:168371:145"/>that teſtimony of the Pſalmiſt, quoted
<hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, who daily loadeth us with benefits, Pſalm.</hi> 68.19. The filling all things in the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is the ſame, that loading with benefits is in the
<hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. From the words following, which are of them as it were an
<hi>exemplification. And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome paſtours and teachers, &amp;c. ver.</hi>
11.</p>
            <p>Every office there mentioned includeth, and preſuppoſeth gifts for it: for ungifted officers are no gift, or bleſſing, but a curſe, and judgment rather. In the words then, as there is expreſſed the inſtitution of Church officers, both extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ordinary, ſo there is implied the qualification of theſe officers with abilities, and endowments for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their ſeverall duties. Now from the qualifying of Church officers with the graces of edification, we may inferre the furniſhing of Church members with the graces of ſanctification: Becauſe thoſe were purpoſely conferred for the production, augmentation, and confirmation of theſe. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Paſtours and teachers; for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, verſ.</hi> 11.12. And the ſaints are not perfected, untill they be filled with grace. The body of Chriſt is not edified, unleſſe Chriſt fill all in all, unleſſe in every part of this body myſticall, all faculties of the ſoule, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body be cloathed with befitting graces.</p>
            <p>In theſe words then, we have a <hi>deſcription of the effuſion of the ſpirit</hi> upon the Church, 1. <hi>a finito.</hi> 2.
<hi>ab adjunctis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſionis &amp; extenſionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Afinito, medio, ſive deſtinato,</hi> the meanes deſigned to make way for it. Chriſt's glorious aſcenſion, <hi>He aſcended far above all heavens, that he might fill all, Joh.</hi> 7.38,39.
<hi>Chapt.</hi> 16.7. It is Chriſts errand, and buſineſſe into heaven; and therefore you may be confident he will mind it, and be very intentive upon the compaſſing of it. The eye, and heart of a wiſe man is almoſt never off from the end of any important action. It were then blaſphemy but to imagine, that Chriſt,<pb n="287" facs="tcp:168371:145"/>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhould not conſtantly have in his conſideration, and intention, the end of ſo glorious and action, as his aſcenſion far above all viſible heavens, into paradiſe, the houſe of God, the third heaven, the heaven of heavens.</p>
            <p>Next we have the <hi>adjuncts</hi> of this <hi>effuſion of</hi> the ſpirit, the <hi>intenſion,</hi> and <hi>extenſion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>intenſion,</hi> meaſure, or degree of it. It was in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that ſparing communication of the ſpirit before Chriſt's aſcenſion, a filling. The ſpirit was not as before, <hi>onely ſprinkled,</hi> but <hi>powred forth.</hi> It did deſcend not in drops,
<hi>or dew,</hi> but <hi>in ſhowers of bleſſing, Ezek.</hi> 24.26.
<hi>The Holy Ghoſt is now ſhed on us abundantly, Tit.</hi> 3.5,6.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>richly,</hi> as it is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the margent: that is, largely, or plenteouſly.</p>
            <p>2. We have the <hi>extenſion</hi> of it: It was a filling of all. He aſcended, that he might fill all: that is, that he might fill the
<hi>univerſall</hi> Church, and every true, and genuine member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The
<hi>ſubject</hi> then of this diſtribution of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, is <hi>generall,</hi> and <hi>univerſall,</hi> and that in as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as the Church is now ſaid to be <hi>Catholick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>1. In reſpect of <hi>place.</hi> It is no longer a little garden incloſed within the territories of Jacob, but a ſpacious field diffuſed,
<hi>ſucceſſively</hi> at leaſt, through all nations, all lands, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>2. In reſpect of the <hi>perſons:</hi> Becauſe this filling excludes no ſort, or condition of men, neither <hi>Jew,</hi> nor Gentile, Greek, nor Barbarian, bond, nor free, male, nor female. Thus <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Carthuſianus</hi> expounds here the univerſall ſigne. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines it unto men, and takes it <hi>diſtributively, de generibus ſingulorum, He aſcended farre above all heavens, ut impleret omnia genera hominum, id eſt, quoſdam de univerſis generibus hominum: donis &amp; gratiis ſpiritus Sancti.</hi> That he might fill all ſorts, kinds, or conditions of men: that is, ſome of all ſorts, with the gifts and graces of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in reſpect of <hi>time:</hi> This diſtribution was not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the times preſently after Chriſts aſcenſion, but if we ſpeake of ordinary <hi>gifts of the Spirit,</hi> to continue untill the

            <p>1. From the <hi>prayers of petition</hi> for it, which doubtleſſe had a gracious anſwere, and returned into the boſomes of thoſe that put them up.

<hi>Timoth.</hi> 1.12,14. We have him preſenting his <hi>thankes unto Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, becauſe the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant</hi> towards himſelfe <hi>with faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And thus have I at large proved, that the members of Chriſt ſhall enjoy every one of them, 1. <hi>A communion</hi> in the
<hi>fulneſſe of Chriſt's grace in their juſtification,</hi> 2. A
<hi>conformitie unto it</hi> in their <hi>ſanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now unto the laſt thing which I promiſed in this uſe, to ſhew, that from the premiſes Chriſt's members may reape a
<hi>double comfort,</hi> 1. <hi>againſt the ſtrength, and fulneſſe of ſinne:</hi> 2. <hi>againſt their wants in, and emptineſſe of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Againſt the ſtrength, and fulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> Naturally there is a fulneſſe of ſinne in us. Our powers and members are full of ſinne. And the very fulneſſe of ſinne is in them. Now where there is a fulneſſe of a thing, there that thing muſt needs be exceeding ſtrong. How ſtrong are the waters of the ſea, onely becauſe the ſea is full of waters, and the fulneſſe of waters is there. Againſt this fulneſſe of ſin now, that is in our natures, we have comfort, nay a full joy, and triumph, in the fulneſſe of grace, that dwelleth in Chriſt: for it is <hi>imputed to us,</hi> that is, <hi>accepted for us.</hi> And <hi>God will make us conformable unto</hi> it. And therefore it gives us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that Chriſt will quench, cure, and expell all our ſins. If in us there be the treaſury of an evill heart, bottomleſſe depths of folly, luſt, and ignorance, in Chriſt there are hid unſearchable riches, and treaſures of grace, and wiſedome. If corruption in us be of an unbounded rage, if we be out of meaſure ſinfull, why the grace of Chriſt is anſwerably of an unſtinted meaſure. <hi>The ſpirit was not given by meaſure unto him, Joh.</hi> 3.34. If ſin abound in us, grace doth much more abound in him. <hi>Excedit quippe pietas Jeſu omnem cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum quantitatem, ſeu numeroſitatem,</hi> as <hi>Bernard in Vigilia nativitatis Domini. Serm.</hi> 1. If the wounds and diſeaſes of our ſoules be many, and deepe, the oyle of gladneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt was anoynted above his fellowes, is able to<pb n="291" facs="tcp:168371:147"/>heale them. <hi>Siquidem ante faciem unctionis Chriſti, nullus omnino ſtare poterit morbus animae, quamlibet inveteratus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> in the but now cited place. <hi>The Yoake</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed, becauſe of the anoynting, Eſay.</hi> 10.27. Where ſome by <hi>yoake</hi> underſtand the yoake of ſinne; and by <hi>the anoynting</hi> the ſpirituall anoynting of Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt. If unrighteouſneſſe hath a kingdome, and dominion in all men by nature, Chriſt is a King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that will in all his members overthrow the reigne, and dominion of unrighteouſneſſe here in this life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very being, and exiſtence of it in death; that will batter, and weaken all its ſtrong holds now, and utterly raze and demoliſh them then. If our ſoules be overſpread with ſpirituall darkneſſe, and ignorance, with the noyſome fogs, and miſts of iniquity; why Chriſt is a <hi>ſunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> upon the firſt ariſing of which in our hearts, our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and luſts will be diſperſed, and ſcattered; but when it ſhall come to its full ſtrength, then all ſhadowes ſhall fly away,
<hi>Canticl.</hi> 4.1. All darkeſome clouds, nay the thinneſt vapour, as well as the thickeſt miſt, ſhall be diſpelled, and waſted: Even all the remainders of the old man, the leaſt reliques of the fleſh, ſhall have a totall aboliſhment, and be utterly rooted out of the ſoule: All conflicts, and combatings of the Law of the members, with the law of the mind, ſhall then receive an everlaſting period.</p>
            <p>2. Here is <hi>conſolation</hi> againſt their emptineſſe of grace, againſt the wants, weakneſſe, and imperfection of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. How many and great ſoever their wants be, how defective ſoever their graces, how imperfect ſoever their holineſſe, yet by union with Chriſt, and conſequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in, and conformitie unto his fulneſſe, they ſhall be made compleate, and perfect. <hi>Ye are compleate in him, Col.</hi> 2.10. As by reaſon of a compleatneſſe and
<hi>perfection in</hi> him, <hi>imputed to you for juſtiſication,</hi> ſo alſo by a <hi>compleatneſſe from him, really imparted unto you for ſanctification.</hi> Chriſt hath riches, and treaſures for their poverty, a wardrobe for their nakedneſſe, a fulneſſe for their emptineſſe, an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurableneſſe<pb n="292" facs="tcp:168371:148"/>of the ſpirit to ſupply any deficiency, to remove any decayes of grace, and to make up whatſoever is wanting for the full faſhioning of Chriſt in their hearts. Indeed an
<hi>abſolute fulneſſe</hi> is not to be expected, as long as we carry about us theſe robes of fraile fleſh. Here ſomething will ſtill be lacking to our faith, and other graces. As the ſunne communicateth it's light unto the moone, leaſurely, by degrees, till ſhe come to her full light, till it be full moone. So Chriſt the ſunne of righteouſneſſe
<hi>gradually</hi> conformeth his members unto that fulneſſe of grace, which dwelleth in him; So that here below, they are but in a ſtate of infancy, and ſo ſubject to defects. But yet he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out his ſpirit and grace upon them in ſuch order, and meaſure, as that they proceede
<hi>from ſtrength to ſtrenth, Pſalm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 84.7. <hi>like the ſunne to the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 8.18. Untill at laſt they arrive unto an
<hi>abſolute fulneſſe</hi> of grace, in reſpect both of <hi>parts, and degrees,</hi> incompatible as with <hi>mixture,</hi> ſo with
<hi>meaſure,</hi> admitting neither of decay, nor growth. Then they ſhall be at the well-head, and therefore brimme-full of grace, each according to his capacity. They ſhall have ſo much grace, as they can hold. <hi>When I awake</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. I ſhall be full of thy Image; it is by ſome tranſlated <hi>filled with all the fulneſſe of God, Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. Unto us then God <hi>will be all in all,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. Unto the <hi>reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> deſcants upon thoſe words, he will be <hi>plenitudo lucis,</hi> unto the <hi>will multitudo pacis,</hi> unto the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory continuatio aeternitatis.</hi> Here we are but ſprinkled with the ſpirit, with a few drops of it: In heaven it ſhall be poured moſt plentifully upon us. Here we are but covered with a parcell of grace, and holineſſe, there we ſhall be cloathed all over with it. There ſhall be no more any ſpots, blemiſhes, or wrinckles in our holineſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. No longer any eb's of our graces, any fainting of our hope, any dulneſſe in our devotion, any drooping of our love, any languiſhing of our zeale. All ſhall be blowne into a purer flame, and advanced to a degree of Angelicall ſublimitie. Thoſe firſt fruites of the ſpirit, which are but ſowne in our<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168371:148"/>ſeede time here, ſhall then ariſe, &amp; grow up into a full harveſt of grace, an entire, pure, unmixed, &amp; abſolute fulneſſe: <hi>For then we ſhall all come, &amp;c. unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature,</hi> or age, <hi>of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. Of which words I ſhall reckon up <hi>three</hi> of the moſt probable expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I have met with. And they proceed according unto the threefold acception of Chriſt in ſcripture. It is taken, 1. <hi>For Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> 2. For <hi>the Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 4.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> that is, untill the Image of Chriſt be ſtamp't upon you; conſiſting in the knowledge of him, &amp; conformitie unto him both in qualitie, &amp; practiſe, as Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> ſheweth at large upon the place.</p>
            <p>3. It is taken <hi>myſtically,</hi> for Chriſt conſidered as a head joyned with his body, the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>1. If you take <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, for <hi>Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> Why then anſwerably the fulneſſe of Chriſt is to be underſtood of ſuch a fulneſſe, as was <hi>formally</hi> in Chriſt himſelfe, either in the graces of his ſoule, or in the ſtature, and growth of his body. Unto the meaſure of both which we may be ſaid to come in regard of our graces at the reſurrection, <hi>analogically</hi> and
<hi>proportionally.</hi> Becauſe there ſhall then be in our graces a fulneſſe or perfection of degree, or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Even as there was in the graces of Chriſt from the very firſt moment of his conception, as there was in the growth of his body at his reſurrection.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be here put for the <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt, then the fulneſſe of Chriſt is to be underſtood,
<hi>exemplariter,</hi> of a full conformitie unto the fulneſſe of grace, and glory in Chriſt. At the reſurrection our reſemblance of Chriſt ſhall be full and perfect, the Image of Chriſt ſhall be fully framed, or faſhioned in us. So that then we ſhall receive the full ſhape of Chriſtians: Chriſt ſhall then (<hi>As Muſculus upon</hi> the place expreſſeth it) <hi>grandeſcere in nobis.</hi> Our now weake, and as it were, infant graces ſhall then come unto a perfect man, unto a ripe age, unto the <hi>meaſure of the ſtature of fulneſſe,</hi> or <hi>unto the meaſure of a full ſtature,</hi> and be in nothing defective, not ſo much as in point of degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:168371:149"/>Thirdly, If Chriſt be taken
<hi>Myſtically,</hi> why then the fulneſſe of Chriſt here is
<hi>extrinſick,</hi> the ſame with that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. <hi>The Church, which is his body, the fulneſſe of him, that filleth all in all.</hi> And then the meaning of the words is, untill the <hi>myſticall</hi> body of Chriſt grow to ripeneſſe, and perfection, untill all that belong to the election of grace, all that be ordained to eternall life, be gathered, and added unto the Church, and untill every member arrive unto a full growth, unto a full meaſure of grace, and glory. And this I conceive to be the moſt probable ſence of the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as <hi>Cornel. A lapide</hi> well obſerveth, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>untill we come to a perfect man,</hi> and not, <hi>untill we come unto perfect men:</hi> becauſe he ſpeakes not of Chriſtians, conſidered ſeverally, but rather of the whole Church, which he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto one perfect man, of which man the Church is as it were the body, Chriſt himſelfe the ſoule, and head. Now when the body commeth unto it's fulneſſe of growth, the head alſo commeth thereunto; as alſo the ſtrength, vigour, quicknance, and efficacy of the ſoule; its union with, and information of the body, which (though the ſoule it ſelfe be indiviſible) is diviſible, and conſequently coextended with the body. Even ſo in like manner, when all the members, that ſhall be added unto the Church, ſhall come unto their full growth, and perfection in grace; why then Chriſt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under a <hi>myſticall capacity,</hi> as head of his Church, may be ſaid to come unto his full growth, age, or ſtature too: And his union with his Church and members will then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely be full, and compleate.</p>
            <p>I come in the laſt place unto <hi>the uſes of exhortation.</hi> From the all-fulneſſe of Chriſt's grace, we may be exhorted unto two duties, 1. <hi>Humiliation</hi> for the imperfection of our graces; 2. <hi>Diligence,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy</hi> in the growth of our graces.</p>
            <p>1. Unto Humiliation for the imperfection that is in our owne graces: and to give the better edge unto this exhortation, I ſhall propound
<hi>two motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The perfection of the holineſſe of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> ſhould mind us of that perfect holineſſe, which we loſt in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:168371:149"/>the <hi>firſt Adam.</hi> And reflexion on ſuch an unvaluable loſſe cannot but ſtrike the heart of any one with a deepe meaſure of godly ſorrow, that is not ignorant of the worth, and neceſſity of grace.</p>
            <p>2. All aberrations from the rule are blemiſhes; and therefore ſeeing our graces fall ſo infinitely ſhort of that perfection, which is in the patterne of grace, Chriſt Jeſus, all our graces are defective, and ſinfull, and ſo preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſpirituall mourning. Can we behold the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and not bluſh at the menſtruous rag's of our own righteouſneſſes? Can we looke upon the bottomleſſe fountaine of holineſſe in Chriſt, and not be aſhamed of our ſhallow brooke, that would ſoone waxe dry, if it were not continually ſupplied from the aforeſaid fountaine? Alas! what are our drops unto his ocean? our ſparks, or beames unto his ſunne? His gifts and graces were in compariſon of ours unmeaſurable. <hi>God gave not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him:</hi> But what a narrow meaſure is there in the brighteſt gifts, and endowments of the moſt glorious ſaints, that ever lived upon the face of the earth. And this meaſure ariſeth from mixture with contrary luſts, and corruptions. The Holy Ghoſt repleniſhed the heart of Chriſt from the very conception: The <hi>word</hi> was no ſooner <hi>made fleſh,</hi> but it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was
<hi>full of grace, and truth;</hi> But Satan hath filled our hearts from the very wombe with a body of ſin, and death, armies of luſts and corruptions like the <hi>Midianites,</hi> which <hi>lay</hi> on the ground like
<hi>graſhoppers for multitude, Judg.</hi> 7.12. As ſoone as we were conceived, we were forthwith full of all the ſeeds of ſinne, ignorance, and errour. In Chriſt were unſearchable riches of grace: But we are like the foole in the Goſpell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.21. that was not <hi>rich towards God.</hi> Like the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Revel.</hi> 3.18. that was
<hi>wretched, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, poore, blind, naked.</hi> In him were hid all the treaſures of wiſedome, and knowledge; <hi>In us there are</hi> (to allude unto the expreſſion of the <hi>Prophet</hi> upon another occaſion,
<hi>Eſay.</hi> 45.3.) <hi>treaſures of darkneſſe, the treaſury of an evill heart, Math.</hi> 12.34,35. The ſonne of man was cloathed with a garment of holineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e downe to the foote, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.13. <pb n="296" facs="tcp:168371:150"/>Whereas the robe of our graces is farre more narrow, and ſcanty, then the filthy garments of our corruptions. Chriſt was a lambe without blemiſh, and without ſpot: Whereas alas there is a ſpot in the deareſt Children of God, <hi>Deut.</hi>
32.5. the ſpot of Originall, and Actuall ſinne: their pureſt graces, and moſt ſpirituall duties are beſpotted, and diſtained by the adheſion of ſinfull luſts, and corruptions. The eyes of Chriſt are pure, white, and precious, like orient Jewels, or ſparkling Diamonds. <hi>His eyes are as the eies of doves by the rivers of water, waſhed with milke, and fitly ſet,</hi> or (as it is in the margent) <hi>ſitting in fulneſſe: that is, fitly placed, and ſet as a precious ſtone in the foile of a ring, Cant.</hi> 5.10. But now our eyes are not onely darke, and dimme, but impure, and uncleane, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. full of Adultery. <hi>Grace was poured into his lips, Pſal.</hi> 4.2.5. <hi>his lips are full of grace,</hi> tis in the old tranſlation: But now our tongues are <hi>full of deadly poyſon, Jam.</hi> 3.8. Our <hi>mouthes are full of curſing and bitterneſſe, Rom.</hi> 3.14. God anoynted Jeſus Chriſt with the holy Ghoſt, and he went <hi>about doing good, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 10.38. But that the greateſt part of men have received no ſuch anoynting is witneſſed by their
<hi>unact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iveneſſe</hi> for the glory of God, and good of the Church: They are as <hi>unprofitable burdens unto the earth,</hi> as the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> whoſe <hi>iniquity was fulneſſe of bread and the abundance of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Ezek.</hi> 16.49.</p>
            <p>2. We may hence be exhorted unto <hi>diligence,</hi> and
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> in the growth of our graces. For let our progreſſe in them be never ſo great, yet ſtill we ſhall come farre behind out patterne, and never be able here to reach his all-fulneſſe. Thoſe that learne to write, will labour to come as nigh their copy, as they can. And in all handy-crafts, learners endeavour a full conformitie unto their rules, and patternes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude, that we can never be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the holineſſe of Chriſt, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto us for a ſamplar to imitate. He was full of grace, and therefore we can never be gracious enough. In him were hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And therefore we can never be knowing enough. We deſire a full conformitie unto the glory, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt; And therefore it is very irrationall to<pb n="297" facs="tcp:168371:150"/>thinke upon a ſtay or ſtoppe in the <hi>way</hi> thereunto, to wit, a conformity unto his grace, and holineſſe. What is ſpoken of the degrees of grace and light in the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. may be applied unto every Chriſtian. In his firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>he looketh forth as the morning:</hi> When he arriveth unto further maturity, <hi>he is faire as the moone,</hi> that hath a mixture of ſpots with her fulleſt light: But in the ſtate of glory, he will be <hi>cleare as the ſunne.</hi> But though for the perfection of his grace, he ſhall reſemble the light of the bodily ſunne, yet his brightneſſe can never equall the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe. We ſhould not therefore content our ſelves with a
<hi>dawning light,</hi> with <hi>the twi-light,</hi> with <hi>ſtarre or moone-light,</hi> but our hearty prayer and unfeigned endeavour ſhould be, that our <hi>path may be as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There dwelled in Chriſt's manhood an
<hi>all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of power. In the mid'ſt of the throne ſtood a lambe, as it had been ſlaine, having ſeven hornes, and ſeven eies, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 5.6. It had <hi>ſeven hornes,</hi> a fulneſſe of <hi>power</hi> to execute, as well as <hi>ſeven eies,</hi> a <hi>perfection</hi> of wiſedome to contrive, whatſoever was needfull for the protection, and guidance of the Church. In the <hi>ſtate of humiliation,</hi> Chriſt's manhood had power of working miraculous, and ſupernaturall effects: it caſt Divels out of thoſe, that were poſſeſſed with them: cured many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that were incurable by naturall meanes: reſtored ſight to thoſe, that were borne blind: raiſed the dead unto life: one from the bed, another from the beere, and a third from the grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. The very wind and the ſea obeyed him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.41. And now in his
<hi>ſtate of exaltation,</hi> his humanity is ſtill inſtrumentall, in the all-powerfull works of Vocation, and ſanctification: And in the laſt day, it will be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inſtrument in the reſurrection, and full glorification of all the Saints.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, diſtinguiſh we of a <hi>twofold power:</hi> one <hi>morall,</hi> by <hi>way of impetration:</hi> ſecondly, another <hi>Phyſicall, by way of proper, and reall influxe, or efficiency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We grant, that Chriſts humanity had, and ſtill hath a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:168371:151"/>
               <hi>morall power</hi> of working miracles, and all workes above the courſe of nature. Looke, as men are ſaid to have a power of doing that, which they commonly effect by their intereſt in their friends, as by the prevalency of their wealth: So the manhood of Chriſt is ſo intereſted in the favour of God, as that it can prevaile with him for doing whatſoever pleaſeth him in heaven and in earth. This <hi>morall power,</hi> &amp;c. was congruent unto Chriſt in <hi>his ſtate of humiliation,</hi> in regard of his propheticall office, for the confirmation of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was ſo farre above the reach of naturall reaſon, as that it would hardly find acceptance with the ſons men, unleſſe it had been back't with wonders, and miracles of an unqueſtionable veritie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. And no leſſe requiſite is it unto his manhood, now 'tis exalted at the right hand of God, for the gathering, ruling, and protecting of, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his ſubjects; as alſo for the reſtraining, overruling, and finally ſubduing all his, and his Churches adverſaries. That this is all the power Chriſt's humanity hath of working miracles is affirmed not only by
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Papiſts, Vaſquez, Becanus;</hi> and amongſt the ancient <hi>Schoolmen</hi> by <hi>Alenſis, Bonaventure, Scotus.</hi> Chriſt's ſoule (ſaith

            <p>Yea, but you will ſay, this <hi>power</hi> of working miracles by <hi>impetration</hi> was communicated unto ſome of the Prophets, unto the Apoſtles, and diverſe primitive ſaints, and therefore not the peculiar priviledge of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwere:</hi> This <hi>morall power</hi> of working miracles was in them only in a <hi>tranſient way,</hi> as they were prompted by the holy ſpirit. <hi>God bearing them witneſſe, both with ſignes, and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his owne will, Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. God followed his owne will, not theirs, in the working of miracles. Though <hi>Gehazi</hi> by the direction of
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.31. laid his ſtaffe upon the face of the <hi>Shunamites</hi> child, for the raiſing of it from the dead; Yet God, we ſee, withdrew his help, and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>this power</hi> was in Chriſts humanity,
<hi>permanently,</hi> and as it were, <hi>habitually:</hi> For he alwaies could, and ſtill can prevaile with God, whenſoever pleaſed him for the working of any miracle, for the illightning of any mind, though never ſo darke, for the ſanctifying of any heart, though never ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, &amp; carnall. The <hi>will</hi> of Chriſts manhood, although it be a <hi>humane will</hi> is yet the <hi>will</hi> of a <hi>divine perſon,</hi> and therefore if it be <hi>abſolute,</hi> it is alwaies <hi>effectuall,</hi> &amp; ſucceſſefull. He never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, &amp; effectually willed any thing, but what was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto Gods abſolute will, the will of his decree, or good pleaſure. And therefore thoſe prayers of his, which proceeded from this <hi>abſolute will</hi> of his, were alwaies heard <hi>John.</hi> 11.42. This <hi>morall power</hi> of Chriſts manhood I have treated of at large in what I have ſaid touching the <hi>fulneſſe of Chriſts office, and authority;</hi> and therefore I might take my leave of this point, if ſome
<hi>Papiſts</hi> did not aſcribe unto Chriſts humanity, not onely a
<hi>morall,</hi> but alſo a <hi>phyſicall power</hi> of working miraculous, and ſupernaturall effects, whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I ſhall briefely examine, and ſo paſſe on.</p>
            <p>This <hi>phyſicall power</hi> is by way of <hi>proper,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>It is agreed on all hands, that the manhoood of Chriſt hath not ſuch a <hi>phyſicall power</hi> of working miracles, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long's unto a

               <hi>authour of nature, that hath power above nature.

            <p>All the controverſy then is concerning ſuch a <hi>phyſicall power,</hi> as is <hi>inſtrumentall;</hi> and here <hi>Capreolus, Cajetan, Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis, Suarez, Gregory de Valentia,</hi> and others maintaine, that it worketh miraculous, and ſupernaturall effects, as <hi>a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtrument</hi> of the Deitie.</p>

<hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> between the <hi>principall cauſe</hi> and the <hi>effect,</hi> but alſo betwixt the <hi>principall cauſe</hi> and the <hi>inſtrument;</hi> becauſe the <hi>effect</hi> iſſueth, or proceedeth from the principall cauſe by the inſtrument: And the
<hi>inſtrument</hi> doth that really, and truly, which before it did not. Now if there be in the effect any ſuch <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>emanation</hi> from, and dependancy upon the inſtrument, <hi>then it is either out of the nature of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe by ſome change wrought in the inſtrument.</hi> Now to apply this unto our purpoſe. If the miracles, and other ſupernaturall workes wrought by Chriſt, carry the relation of an effect unto Chriſts humanity, as a <hi>phyſicall,</hi> and <hi>proper inſtrument,</hi> why then this reference is either according <hi>unto the nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's humanity,</hi> conſidered in it ſelfe; or elſe by <hi>vertue</hi> of ſome new <hi>change wrought</hi> in the
<hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:168371:152"/>1. <hi>They</hi> themſelves will confeſſe, that it is meerely by the will and good pleaſure of God, and therefore not by <hi>any naturall vertue of the humanity.</hi> If they ſay, that it is by ſome <hi>ſuperadded vertue,</hi> whether <hi>permanent,</hi> or <hi>tranſient,</hi> it matters not: Why then, I demand, Whether this
<hi>ſuperadded vertue</hi> be <hi>naturally</hi> in it's owne nature, conſidered in it ſelfe, <hi>proportioned,</hi> or utterly
<hi>diſproportioned</hi> unto any thing in theſe miraculous, and ſupernaturall effects. If it carry no <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall proportion</hi> unto any thing in them; why then, it ſelfe will need a new, and farther elevation, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or derivation of it, unto the humanity, will be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather uſeleſſe to elevate it unto ſuch a height of activity, as is pleaded for. If you ſay of this <hi>ſuperadded vertue,</hi> that it hath any <hi>naturall proportion</hi> unto ſomething in theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and ſupernaturall effects, why then, it hath alſo <hi>ſome previous action,</hi> naturally proportioned unto ſomething or other in them: and what that is could never yet be by any aſſigned, or ſo much as imagined.

            <p>1. Some ſuppoſe, that the manhood of Chriſt may be elevated unto a <hi>phyſicall</hi> inſtrumentary <hi>efficiency</hi> of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſupernaturall effects, meerely by <hi>conjunction with, and actuall ſubordination unto</hi> the vertue of the Godhead, as the principall Agent, without any power of agency ſeated in the manhood. This conceit is oppoſed by <hi>Suarez in tert. part. Thomae diſp.</hi> 31. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6.
<hi>pag.</hi> 493, 494. and others, upon this ground. Becauſe the progreſſe of an Agent, or efficient, unto its <hi>ſecond act, action,</hi> preſuppoſeth in it the <hi>firſt act,</hi> an <hi>active power. A forreigne power</hi> without it <hi>extrinſecally</hi> aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it will not ſerve the turne: it muſt be a power
<hi>intrinſecall</hi> unto the efficient, either by <hi>way of identity, or information.</hi> The <hi>actions</hi> of God preſuppoſe an <hi>active</hi> power in him by way of <hi>identity:</hi> The actions of the creatures preſuppoſe active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in them, that are qualities. Indeed
<hi>metaphorically, and improperly,</hi> we may be ſaid to be able to doe that, which we can procure to be done by our friends, or by our money. But to ſpeake <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>phyſically,</hi> no Agent whatſoever can be ſaid to be able for an action, ſo much as in an <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall way,</hi> that hath not in it ſomething, that is a principle of ſuch an action. But now this ſubordination of the manhood unto the Godhead, is meerely by <hi>extrinſecall denomination.</hi> For, as they ſtate it, it neither preſuppoſeth, nor addeth <hi>any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power</hi> unto the manhood, that is <hi>formally</hi> &amp; <hi>intrinſecally</hi> in it. The Vertue, or active power of the Godhead ſubſiſts in the Godhead it ſelfe, and is <hi>eſſentiall</hi> unto it: and therefore the manhood cannot be <hi>formally,</hi> and <hi>intrinſecally</hi> inveſted with
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:168371:153"/>it; and conſequently it cannot thereby beexalted to be a <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtrument</hi> of miraculous, and <hi>ſupernaturall actions,</hi> of producing which, it hath not in it ſelfe any active power.</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſay the <hi>fautors</hi> of this opinion, an
<hi>inſtrument workes not in its proper vertue,</hi> but in the <hi>vertue of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall efficient:</hi> Therefore <hi>immediate conjunction</hi> with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the principall cauſe, is ſufficient to conſtitute, and denominate an inſtrument, <hi>in actu primo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwere:</hi> that uſuall ſaying may have two
<note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Suarez in tert. part. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae diſp.</hi> 31. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 496.</note> ſences: Either that there is an <hi>utter nullity</hi> of vertue: or that there is an
<hi>improportion</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency</hi> in the vertue of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards their effects.</p>
            <p>1. That there is an utter, and abſolute nullity of vertue in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments towards their effects, that they worke not by any vertue, which they have, <hi>intrinſecally,</hi> in themſelves, but only by the
<hi>extrinſecall vertue</hi> of the principall agent. And this if we ſpeake of <hi>phyſicall</hi> inſtruments is moſt untrue. For action is a
<hi>ſecond act;</hi> and therefore ever preſuppoſeth in the Agent, which it denominateth, <hi>a firſt act,</hi> an active power, not onely
<hi>extrinſecall,</hi> which is without it, but alſo
<hi>intrinſecall,</hi> which is either in it, or really the ſame with it. Impoſſible is it, for any thing to have ſo much as an <hi>inſtrumentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> unto that in reſpect of which it is not cloathed with a power of Agency.</p>
            <p>2. This ſaying may have another meaning: It may denote onely the
<hi>improportion,</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of the vertue, that is in inſtruments towards their effects, that they are not able of themſelves to produce their effects, without the ſupply, and aſſiſtance, or motion, and application of their principall efficient. Thus an <hi>axe</hi> though it hath an edge, a fitneſſe to cut, yet it cannot actualy cut, unleſſe it be applied by the hand of the workeman. And this ſence I grant to be true, and ſound; but then it maketh nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond evaſion,</hi> which others fly to, is an
<hi>obedientiall active power, compleated</hi> by the extraordinary concurſe of God; and here they paſſe <hi>ab hypotheſi ad theſin;</hi> and affirme, there is ſuch a power in every creature. Looke, ſay they, as there is an<pb n="304" facs="tcp:168371:154"/>
               <hi>obedientiall paſſive power,</hi> in every creature to receive what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foever God will put into it, and to be made whatſoever God will make of it. <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up Children unto Abraham, Math.</hi> 3.9. So likewiſe there is in every creature an <hi>obedientiall active power,</hi> whereby it may be elevated unto the working of whatſoever God will effect by it. According unto this power, the <hi>ſacraments</hi> (ſay they) are elevated to be
<hi>phyſicall inſtruments</hi> of grace: <hi>Materiall fire</hi> in hell inabled to burne, and torment ſpirits: the words of conſecration in the mouth of a maſſing prieſt, exalted to be <hi>phyſically</hi> inſtrumentall in the <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> of bread and wine into the body, and blood of Chriſt. This power they tearme <hi>radicall</hi> or
<hi>fundamentall,</hi> becauſe it is undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the entity of every creature, and ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing thereunto but a
<hi>non-repugnancy,</hi> or a <hi>relation.</hi> And they call it alſo a
<hi>remote power,</hi> becauſe it hath only an <hi>inchoate,</hi> and
<hi>incompleate</hi> proportion unto miraculous, and ſupernaturall effects, which is compleated by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary concurſe, or influence of God, elevating the creature beyond the power, and force of it's owne nature.</p>
            <p>For <hi>anſwere,</hi> 1. The inſtances they bring for confirmation of this <hi>obedientiall active power,</hi> are a moſt pitifull, and miſerable begging of the queſtion: for they are denied by not onely
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but alſo <hi>Papiſts,</hi> As <hi>Vaſquez, Becanus, Faber Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus,</hi> and generally all <hi>Scotiſts:</hi> And if I gueſſe not amiſſe, this knack was devis'd for the ſupport of the ſacraments <hi>phyſicall efficiency</hi> of grace; As alſo of the phyſicall operative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſle of the words of conſecration, in that new an impious figment of <hi>tranſubſtantiation.</hi> To bring then theſe
<hi>two,</hi> as a chiefe proofe thereof, bewrayes a great barrenneſſe of other arguments. <hi>Revius</hi> in his <hi>Suarez repurgatus pag.</hi> 922,
923. ſuppoſeth that this <hi>obedientiall active power</hi> in every creature unto any effect, is a kind of omnipotency; The attribution of which unto a creature, every one will acknowledge to be blaſphemous. Indeed
<hi>Suarez in tert. part. Thomae. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 31. §. 6.
<hi>p.</hi> 509. ſtickes not to tearme it, omnipotency. And afterwards,
<hi>pag.</hi> 514, 515. he ſaith, that though it be finite, and limited
<hi>intenſively,</hi> and <hi>entitatively,</hi> yet it is infinite,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168371:154"/>and unlimited <hi>extenſively,</hi> and
<hi>objectively:</hi> It may be extended unto any thing whatſoever, which God can doe, either by himſelfe, or by any other creature. I know, they will ſay, that this omnipotency is but <hi>ſubordinate, ſecondary, derived, and inſtrumentary.</hi> But omnipotency is an incommunicable attribute of the Deitie: and to <hi>talke</hi> of a communication of incommunicable attributes is new and ſtrange <hi>divinity.

            <p>But I ſhall more particularly argue againſt this
<hi>obedientiall active power,</hi> 1. from the <hi>diſtribution</hi> of an
<hi>active power, in</hi> generall, 2. From the <hi>utter diſproportion,</hi> that is betweene any creature, and ſupernaturall or miraculous effects, 3. From <hi>a compariſon</hi> betwixt an <hi>obedientiall active</hi> and
<hi>paſſive power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>adequate diſtribution</hi> of an <hi>active power, in generall.</hi> Every active power of

               </gap>creature is <hi>either naturall, or ſupernaturall.</hi> For it is either it's entity, or naturall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and then it is naturall: or elſe it is <hi>ſupernaturally</hi> ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and infuſed by God, and then it is <hi>ſupernaturall.</hi> But now this <hi>obedientiall active power</hi> is neither <hi>naturall,</hi> nor <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.</hi> It is <hi>not naturall,</hi> for then what proportion could it have unto ſupernaturall effects? neither is it
<hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> becauſe it is ſay <hi>the inventors</hi> of it, really the ſame with the nature of every creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suarez</hi> anſwereth, that however this <hi>obedientiall active power</hi> be ſometimes <hi>naturall,</hi> ſometimes
<hi>ſupernaturall, entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> in regard of it's entity, yet it can never be naturall <hi>quoad uſum, ſeu quoad munus potentiae, vel quoad modum agendi, quia non agit juxta commenſurationem, vel propriam inſtitutionem, ſeu ſpecificationem ſuae entitatis, neque cum concurſu, ſeu auxilio ſibi debito, nec denique ad effectum, vel actionem ſuae naturae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionatam.

            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:168371:155"/>Unto This I reply, that there is a ſuitableneſſe, or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt every active power, and the adequate uſe, or application thereof: and therefore, if the entity of this
<hi>obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall active</hi> power be naturall, ſo muſt alſo the adequate, and totall uſe, and application thereof be too.</p>
            <p>A ſecond argument is from the utter, and totall diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that is betwixt every creature, and miraculous and ſupernaturall effects.</p>
            <p>I know, they diſtinguiſh of a <hi>compleate,</hi> or
<hi>conſummate,</hi> and an <hi>inchoate,</hi> or <hi>incompleate</hi> proportion unto any thing, that God can produce either <hi>immediately</hi> by himſelfe, or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> by any other creature.</p>
            <p>But can they expreſſe, or imagine, what <hi>inchoate</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is in a ſtone unto the <hi>beatificall viſion,</hi> or in a fly unto the production of an Angell. Are not things materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and immateriall altogeither diſproportioned? What <hi>Phyſicall</hi> influence can water, or fire have upon the efficiency of grace, faith, hope, or love? And anſwerably how can grace be <hi>phyſically</hi> productive of water or fire? Some creatures are in regard of qualities contrary; and therefore impoſſible they ſhould be in any the leaſt degree proportioned, in regard of mutuall production. What proportion can there be in fire, unto the production of water; or in water, unto the production of fire? I know, the
<hi>patrons</hi> of this <hi>obedientiall active power</hi> ſwallow theſe, and greater abſurdities, of which the rehearſall is a ſufficient confutation. And I confeſſe, I ſhould be tranſported with juſt wonder at the infatuation of ſuch rationall men, if the Apoſtle had not told me, 2
<hi>The.</hi> 2.10,11,12. <hi>That becauſe ſome men receive not the love of the truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, &amp;c.</hi> If any one yet deſire a refutation of ſuch ſenceleſſe fopperies, they may meet with it in their own

                  <hi>In quartum ſentent. diſp.</hi> 2.
<hi>p.</hi> 15, 16.</note> latter of which I ſhall inſert this following argument. <hi>If there be an obedientiall active power inevery creature unto any effect whatſoever, then there is in an ant, or piſmire, ſuch a power unto the acts of underſtanding, or willing; and oonſequently an ant, or piſmire, remaining an ant, or piſmire without any change at all in it's nature, may by God be elevated<pb n="307" facs="tcp:168371:155"/>to enjoy God, to underſtand, diſcourſe, which are effects, that not onely ſurmount it's nature, but are alſo repugnant thereunto. For what groſſer contradictions can there be, then to affirme, that a liveleſſe being, whiles ſuch, can be inabled for the performance of vitall operations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt argument ſhall be drawne from a compariſon of an
<hi>obedientiall active power with</hi> an <hi>obedientiall paſſive power.</hi> There is more limitation in that, then in this: For there is no creature, but can ſuffer that, which it cannot doe, can receive that, which it cannot produce. But now the <hi>obedientiall paſſive</hi> power of every creature is limited, therefore ſo alſo is it's <hi>obedientiall active power.</hi> No creature is capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things, much leſſe can it be advanced unto ſuch a pitch of efficiency, as to be <hi>phyſically inſtrumentall</hi> in the working of all things. That every creature is not capable of receiving all things, is thus proved out of the ſubtile
<hi>Scotus.</hi> Things materiall are not capable of receiving things ſpirituall: and ſpirituall, or immateriall things are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving things bodily, or materiall. <hi>A ſtone</hi> cannot receive
<hi>wiſedome;</hi> nor an <hi>Angell, whiteneſſe:</hi> For then we may denominate, a ſtone, to be wiſe; an Angell, to be white. I know,
<hi>Franciſcus bonae Spei in</hi> 8. <hi>libros Phyſ. Ariſt. pag.</hi>
131. acknowledgeth all theſe things to he poſſible. But then a thing altogeither irtationall may be rationall, a ſpirituall ſubſtance may be corporeall, which are ſuch groſſe contradictions, that an ordinary underſtanding may eaſily diſcerne them.</p>
            <p>And thus have I proved in generall, that there is no
<hi>phyſicall inſtrumentall power</hi> in Chriſt's humanity of working any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall or miraculous effects.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next bring one argument to prove this particularly concerning ſuch ſupernaturall, or miraculous effects, as were, or are wrought by Chriſt at a <hi>remote diſtance from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi> A phyſicall cauſe cannot worke, unleſſe it be <hi>preſent.</hi> Impoſſible to write here by a penne at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon <hi>Aquinas Sum. part.</hi> 1. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 8. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. proves Gods omnipreſence from his influence upon, or cooperation with all things. But now many miracles were wrought<pb n="308" facs="tcp:168371:156"/>by Chriſt at too great a diſtance, to conveigh any <hi>phyſicall influxe</hi> from his manhood. Thus he cured the <hi>Centurions</hi> ſervant, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.8,13. and the rulers ſonne, unto whom he never approached, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.50,51,52,53. and therefore he healed them by the omnipotency of his Godhead, and not by any
<hi>phyſicall</hi> power of his manhood. The <hi>heavens receive the humanity of Chriſt untill the times of reſtitution of all things, Acts</hi> 3.21. And at ſuch a diſtance there can be no <hi>phyſicall contact</hi> betwixt it, and the ſoules of men, and therefore it cannot be <hi>phyſically inſtrumentall</hi> in their regeneration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Chriſt may be conſidered according unto his
<hi>two fold ſtate</hi> of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>exalation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. According unto his <hi>ſtate of humiliation;</hi> and in that there was a <hi>fulneſſe of ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>merit:</hi> a
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to make ample amends unto Gods enraged juſtice: a <hi>fulneſſe of merit</hi> to purchaſe reconciliation, acceptation of both their perſons and ſervices, the image of God, the kingdome of heaven, and an inheritance of glory. This ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts ſatisſaction and merit was <hi>firſt, typified</hi> under the Old Teſtament. <hi>ſecondly, aſſerted</hi> in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
<hi>Thirdly, really evidenced</hi> by his exaltation, as a ſigne.
<hi>Fourthly, clearly demonſtrated</hi> from the worthineſſe and infiniteneſſe of his perſon, as the cauſe and originall thereof.</p>
            <p>1. It was <hi>typified</hi> under the Old Teſtament: I ſhall at this preſent inſtance but in <hi>three types</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. The

<hi>Lev.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Judges</hi> 6.17,21. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1,3. 1
<hi>King.</hi> 18.38,39.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>compleatneſſe</hi> of the daily bloudy ſacrifice: for that had conjoyned together with it the unbloudy ſacrifice of the meat offering; and another of the drinke offering, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40. And the fuller the ſacrifice was, the more it did reſemble the ſufficiency of Chriſts humiliation.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The ſweetneſſe</hi> of the things required in their meat &amp; drinke<pb n="309" facs="tcp:168371:156"/>offerings, that were joyned with their burnt offerings, flowre, oyle, and wine, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40. unto which we may adde the fragrancy of frankincenſe, which was to be put on their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary meat-offerings,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 2.2,15. Theſe things did ſerve aptly to figure, how ſweet and well pleaſing unto God the ſacrifice of Chriſt ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have this point <hi>plainly aſſerted</hi> in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelfe for us, an offering, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. In which words we have <hi>two</hi> things pertinent unto our preſent purpoſe: the <hi>ſufficiency;</hi> the
<hi>fragrancy</hi> of Chriſts humiliation.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of it. <hi>He gave himſelfe for us, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an offering and a ſacrifice unto God.</hi> Where the firſt word,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifieth either all ſacrifices in <hi>generall,</hi> or elſe unbloudy ones in
<hi>particular,</hi> meat and drink-offerings. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, denoteth bloudy, and ſlaughtered ſacrifices. Now the compariſon of Chriſts humiliation, and obedience, unto an <hi>offering and ſacrifice,</hi> ſheweth that it was the ſubſtance of all offerings, and ſacrifices whatſoever, under the law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unbloudy or bloudy, and that therein they had all their full accompliſhment. There was nothing foreſhadowed by either meat-offerings, drink-offerings, or burnt-offerings, but was perfectly fulfilled in his oblation, &amp; ſacrifice of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have here the <hi>fragrancy,</hi> and acceptableneſſe unto God, of the offering, and ſacrifice of Chriſt.
<hi>He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelfe for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour;</hi> or for a <hi>ſavour of ſweetneſſe:</hi> that is, Chriſts offering and ſacrifice of himſelfe was as acceptable unto God, as the ſweereſt odours are unto mans ſence of ſmelling The Apoſtle plainly alludeth unto the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Old Teſtament, in which God is ſaid to ſmell a ſweet ſavour, or a ſavour of reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi>
8.21. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.9. Burnt fleſh yeilded no pleaſing ſavour unto man; and impoſſible, that <hi>ſimply</hi> conſidered, <hi>as it was in it ſelfe,</hi> it ſhould be as a ſweet odour unto God, <hi>Iſay.</hi>
1.11. In theſe places then, there is a <hi>ſacramentall Metonymy,</hi> by which that is aſcribed unto the ſigne, which agreeth in truth, and indeed, unto the <hi>thing</hi> ſignified, to wit, the ſacrifice of Chriſt.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:168371:157"/>In that alone properly God ſmelleth a ſavour of reſt; that is, it onely propitiateth, or appeaſeth God, and maketh his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to reſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.42. When ſtinking ſmels offend our noſtrils we uſually burne ſome ſweet perfumes, which quiet our diſturbed ſence. There is nothing ſo noyſome, and unſavoury unto God, as our ſinnes. But now the offering, and ſacrifice of Chriſt doth yield ſo fragrant a ſmell, as that it prevaileth above them; ſo that we may ſay, God doth not ſent them; His wrath is pacified; and we ſmell ſweetly in his noſtrill's. The ſufferings of Chriſt made him perfect, as touching his office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>chapt.</hi> 5.8,9. The offering of Chriſt perfects for ever, them, that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10.14. and therefore there was a perfection in his ſufferings, and offering. For nothing that is unperfect in it ſelfe, can communicate perfection unto others. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. there <hi>be two</hi> expreſſions concerning the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, ariſing from his obedience, that ſhew forth the fulneſſe of the ſatisfaction and merit, that was in his obedience. Chriſt's righteouſneſſe is tearmed the
<hi>righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> and it is ſaid to be revealed from
<hi>faith to faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is tearmed the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God:</hi> and that (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit other ſences, impertinent unto our preſent purpoſe)
<hi>two</hi> manner of waies, <hi>perſonally,</hi> or
<hi>objectively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Perſonally:</hi> It was the righteouſneſſe of a perſon, who was God. So that his Godhead gave value, excellency, and efficacy unto it. But of this, I ſhall ſpeake at large, when <hi>I</hi> come to the demonſtration of the point, &amp;c. and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall now onely mention it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Objectively;</hi> and that in a <hi>twofold</hi> regard: <hi>In</hi> regard of it's <hi>acceptation</hi> by God, and
<hi>conſiſtency before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In <hi>regard of it's acceptation by God.</hi> It is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which he fully accepts, and in which he bath a moſt perfect acquieſce nce and complacency. He is well pleaſed, as with the perſon, ſo with the righteouſneſſe of his well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſonne.</p>
            <p>2. In reſpect of it's <hi>conſiſtency</hi> before God. There is no righteouſneſſe, but that, wherein we can ſtand before the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:168371:157"/>tribunall of Gods juſtice, and rigour of his law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The all-ſufficiency, and redundancy of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is ſignified by a <hi>ſecond expreſſion</hi> in the words, the <hi>Revelation of it from faith to faith:</hi> that is, as appeares by compariſon of the forme of ſpeech with others of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 84.7.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. from
<hi>one degree of faith, unto another.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid: It is revealed unto the moſt growing and increaſing faith. If we make never ſo great a progreſſe in faith: If we daily proceed from faith to faith: If our faith grow ſtronger and ſtronger, it will never be able fully to
<hi>comprehend,</hi> however it may in ſome ſort <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. <hi>Eſtius</hi> thinkes, that the phraſe is like unto that, which is uſuall in Scripture, <hi>from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation:</hi> and ſo the meaning of the words is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is revealed unto believers throughout all generations. The ſtrongeſt and moſt
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr Edward Reynolds on Pſalm.</hi>
110. <hi>p.</hi> 467.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged faith of all the Saints, that ever were, are, or ſhall be in the world, is but finite, and therefore can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate unto the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is the righteouſneſſe of God, therefore infinite in worth, unto which no faith whatſoever can have an adequate proportion; and conſequently can never be able to looke beyond it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The fulneſſe of ſatisfaction, and merit in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Chriſt, was really <hi>evidenced</hi> by Chriſts exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a <hi>Signe.</hi> Chriſt was throwne into the priſon of the grave, as our ſurety, and there was no deliverance of him thence, but by payment of the utmoſt farthing, we owed unto Gods juſtice. But now as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>He was taken from priſon and judgement, Iſai.</hi>
53.8. and exalted unto as great an eminency of glory, and authority, as a creature is capable of. God raiſed him from the dead, tooke him up into heaven, placed him at his right hand; and there admitted him unto the glorious exerciſe of an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative interceſſion.</hi> And is not this a moſt convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he hath paid off all our debts, that he hath given a full recompence unto Gods diſpleaſed holineſſe, a ſufficient ſatisfaction unto his juſtice provoked with our ſinnes, and is quitted from that guilt of them, which he aſſumed in<pb n="312" facs="tcp:168371:158"/>our behalfe.

<hi>pag.</hi> 30.</note> Hereupon is it, that our Saviour ſaith,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8,10. <hi>The Spirit, or Comforter, will convince the world of righteouſneſſe, becauſe I goe to my Father, and yee ſe me no more.</hi> Where we have <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of this
<hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the argument, by which it is wrought.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>matter</hi> of it, righteouſneſſe, to wit, of Chriſt; and that not onely <hi>private,</hi> as he is lookt upon under a
<hi>perſonall capacity,</hi> but alſo <hi>publique,</hi> as he is conſidered under a <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall capacity,</hi> as ſurety for, and head of his Church. And this is a righteouſneſſe, which he communicates unto all his members. The meaning of the words then is: The ſpirit ſhall convince the world not onely that Chriſt was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and innocent in his own perſon; and therefore unjuſtly <hi>numbred amongſt the tranſgreſſours,</hi> but alſo that he had righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe enough in him for the juſtification of the whole world.</p>
            <p>2. We have the <hi>argument</hi> by which this conviction is wrought; the aſcenſion of Chriſt into heaven, and the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of his abode, and glory there. <hi>Becauſe I goe to my father, and ye ſee me no more.</hi> Our ſinnes and Gods juſtice would have kept Chriſt ſtill in his grave, and never admitted him into heaven, untill he had fulfilled all righteouſneſſe: that is, performed all the duties, and ſuffered the whole curſe of the law, as touching the ſubſtance thereof. And if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing this, it had been poſſible for him to have preſumed to enter heaven, God would preſently have ſent him downe unto the earth againe, where he ſhould have beene viſible untill he had anſwered the moſt rigorous demands of the law.

            </p>
            <p>4. The fulneſſe of ſatisfaction and merit, that was in Chriſts humiliation, may clearly be demonſtrated from the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infiniteneſſe of his perſon, as the <hi>cauſe and originall</hi> thereof. To cleare this, we ſhall conſider Chriſts humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the notion, 1. of a <hi>price,</hi> 2. of a <hi>ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If we conſider it as a <hi>price,</hi> which he paid for us; ſo by meanes of the worthineſſe of his perſon, it was of great and ineſtimable value. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18,19. All the worth of gold and ſilver was from <hi>humane appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Whereas the dignity of Chriſts blood flowed from the <hi>reall</hi> infiniteneſſe of his perſon &amp; nature. <hi>It was the bloud of God,</hi> Act. 30.28. and
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bilſon.</hi>
               </note> therefore was able <hi>to quench that wrath, that everlaſtingly and intollerably would have burnt againſt us to our finall and perpetuall deſtruction of body and ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be two <hi>ſorts or kinds</hi> of <hi>prices,</hi> which may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Chriſts humiliation: a <hi>price</hi> of
<hi>Ranſome,</hi> and a <hi>price of Purchaſe:</hi> and the fulneſſe of each price therein, ariſeth from the infiniteneſſe of his perſon. Becauſe it was the humiliation of an infinite perſon, therefore it was a
<hi>full price of ranſome,</hi> and a full <hi>price of purchaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A full</hi> and <hi>ſufficient price of ranſome</hi> from the guilt, and dominion of ſin, from the rigour and curſe of the law. With <hi>him is plenteous redemption, and he ſhall redeeme Iſrael from all her iniquities, Pſalm.</hi> 130.7,8. It is a redemption ſo full, and perfect, as that it comprizeth all the ſteps and degrees of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from all ſins, from all the evill that is in ſin, and from all the ſad and miſerable conſequents of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:168371:159"/>2. A full <hi>and ſufficient price</hi> of
<hi>purchaſe</hi> to obtaine the love, likeneſſe, and life of God, righteouſneſſe, favour, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, together with all the gracious and glorious fruites thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we looke upon Chriſts humiliation, as a
<hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which he offered for us: it is by meanes of the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his perſon, an all-pleaſing ſacrifice. <hi>By one offering, he perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14. Now this <hi>infinitas acceptibilitatis,</hi> this great acceptableneſſe, and well-pleaſingneſſe of this ſacrifice unto God, proceeded from the dignity, 1. <hi>of the Prieſt offering,</hi> 2. <hi>of the Sacrifice offered.</hi> 3. <hi>of the Altar, upon which it was offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>Prieſt offering,</hi> the ſon of God, in whom he was well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>2. Of <hi>the Sacrifice offered,</hi> unto which by meanes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall union, the vertue of the Deity was truely attributed. The ſacrifice which he offered, the bloud which he ſhed, the death which he ſuffered, was the ſacrifice, bloud, and death of God: and conſequently the ſacrifice was appliable unto all thoſe, for whom it was offered: able
<hi>to ſprinkle many nations, Iſ.</hi> 52.15. Becauſe it was more then equivalent in dignity, and repreſentation, unto all the perſons of all the men in the world.</p>
            <p>3. From the dignity of the <hi>Altar,</hi> upon which it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; that was the divine nature. <hi>Through the eternall Spirit, he offered himſelfe without ſpot unto God, and ſo by his bloud pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our Conſciences from dead workes, Heb.</hi> 9.14. This Altar ſanctified the offering, made it ſufficient for <hi>Gods ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>mans juſtification:</hi> for it gave it an infinite acceptance with God; ſo that therein he ſmelled a ſweet ſavour of reſt, and was therewith fully pacified and contented. The hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, demerit, and deſert of an offence, is much aggravated from the dignity of the perſon offended, and meanneſſe of the perſon offending. Thoſe revilings, which uttered againſt a mans equalls, are but actionable; if ſpoken againſt a noble man, they prove <hi>ſcandalum magnatum,</hi> and puniſhable with the pillory: if againſt the ſupreame Magiſtrate, they come to be of a treaſonable nature, and puniſhable with death. Even<pb n="315" facs="tcp:168371:159"/>ſo on the other ſide, the value, dignity of ſatisfaction, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, proceedeth principally from the dignity of the perſon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying or meriting. For the quality of the perſon doth dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his worke, &amp; make it of
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tanner.</hi>
               </note> anſwerable value; not as though it had any <hi>reall influence thereupon,</hi> but only as a <hi>morall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> it imparteth to the worke ſuch a reſpect, whereby it deſerveth accordingly. The Kingly dignity hath no
<hi>reall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> upon the actions of the King; it doth not <hi>really advance</hi> their nature, but onely <hi>morally,</hi> as a <hi>morall circumſtance,</hi> it raiſeth their rate and eſtimation, maketh them of a greater eſteeme and account, then otherwiſe they would be. The greatneſſe of honour is increaſed from the excellency of the perſon honouring: For the Prince but to look favourably, to ſpeak kindly unto me, is a greater honour, then the greateſt and moſt crouching obeiſance of inferiours. Now in giving ſatisfaction to a partie wronged, a man honoureth the partie, to whom he giveth it: and therefore the more worthy the perſon ſatisfying, the greater the ſatisfaction. A greater ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction it is for a Prince to aske forgiveneſſe for a wrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then for another to undergoe a far ſharper penalty. Now if the greatneſſe of a mans perſon communicateth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable worth either of ſatisfaction or merit, unto that which he doth, or ſuffereth: what an infinite value then will the infiniteneſſe of Chriſts perſon adde to that, which he wrought for our redemption, for the ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice, and for the acquiſition of an inheritance, and other priviledges for us? The divine, and infinite perſon of Chriſt doth dignify his obedience, and ſufferings, and maketh them of an anſwerable, of a divine, and infinite value, able to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods infinite juſtice, to expiate the infinite guilt of mans ſin: not as though it did <hi>phyſically,</hi> and <hi>really advance</hi> their nature, but only <hi>morally,</hi> as a morall circumſtance, raiſe their value and eſtimation. Let a
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Bayne in his Catechiſme.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>common man preſcribe any thing for my health, and thankes is a ſufficient requitall: But let a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Phyſicke doe it, and a fee is due unto him.</hi> That advice, which delivered by a
<hi>common man, is good cheape, yet comming from a counſeller, ſerjeant, judge, are of great value.</hi> Even ſo that bloud, which Chriſt ſhed, that death, which he ſuffered, if it<pb n="316" facs="tcp:168371:160"/>had been by an ordinary perſon, would have been of no great force; but being by him, who was over all God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, it was of high, indeed infinite price. As ſin, though it be of a finite nature, yet it is, <hi>objectivè,</hi> infinite, as being committed againſt an infinite Majeſty, and ſo meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an infinite wrath and puniſhment. So Chriſts obedience, though it were <hi>metaphyſically,</hi> for its nature, finite, yet it was
<hi>morally</hi> infinite, as being performed by a perſon of infinite dignity and majeſty; and ſo conſequently it was of infinite merit, to appeaſe Gods wrath, and procure all good things in the behalfe of his members. But by reaſon of the infiniteneſſe, dignity of Chriſt, perſon, there was in his obedience and ſufferings, of ſatisfaction and merit, not only a
<hi>fulneſſe of Sufficiency. He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1
<hi>John.</hi> 2.2. But alſo a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>Redundancy.</hi> The ſatisfaction, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and acceptableneſſe of his ſufferings did as farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount (thinkes <hi>Chryſoſteme</hi>) the demerit, malignity, and unpleaſingneſſe of our diſobedience, of our tranſgreſſions, as the vaſt Ocean doth the leaſt drop of water; as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infinite millions doth the debt of ſome few pence. <hi>Speake ye comfortably to Jeruſalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned, for ſhe hath received of the Lords hand double for all her ſins, Iſaiah.</hi> 40.2. to wit, in her head, and ſurety, Chriſt Jeſus. This redundancy, overflowing, and <hi>overplus</hi> (as I may ſay) of Chriſt ſatisfaction will be more apparent, if with the acute
<hi>Albertinus, tom.</hi> 1. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 18. <hi>Theolog. Ex primo principio Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. pag</hi> 135. We will be pleaſed to conſider, that however there was a kind of infiniteneſſe, as well in our ſins againſt God, as in Chriſts ſatisfaction for them; yet this latter infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, was of a higher ranke and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the infiniteneſſe of ſin. Becauſe the <hi>reference</hi> of the ſatisfactory and meritorious workes of Chriſt unto his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perſon, was greater, nearer, and more intimate, then that of ſin unto the infinite nature of God offended thereby: the perſon of Chriſt reſpecting thoſe <hi>formally,</hi> and as it were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally;</hi> becauſe as a <hi>morall circumſtance</hi> it <hi>morally</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:168371:160"/>and dignified them: and the demerit of ſin reſpecting God offended thereby, onely <hi>objectively,</hi> and <hi>extrinſecally,</hi> as outwardly terminating its <hi>reference</hi> unto him; and therefore however from the infinite perſon of Chriſt there redounded unto his ſatisfactory actions, an <hi>abſolute</hi> infiniteneſſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and acceptableneſſe, which was <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply</hi> ſuch, yet from the infinite nature of God offended by ſin, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded unto ſin onely an infiniteneſſe of guilt, and deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a ſort, in ſuch a kind.</p>

The ſame light of the Sun may ſerve for millions <pb n="318" facs="tcp:168371:161"/>of men. So the ſame ſatisfaction of the Sun of righteouſneſſe may be, &amp; is applied unto all the Saints. And indeed if but one ſingle perſon had been ſaved and redeemed, it could have been at no lower a rate, then the whole death of Chriſt; the whole ſatisfaction of Chriſts blood muſt be applied unto ſuch a ſoule, and not only a parcell thereof.

               </gap> that it may be extended unto thoſe, unto whom it is never actually extended.</p>
            <p>But how ſandy a foundation this is for ſuch a ſtructure, is well diſcovered by <hi>Ames.</hi> Becauſe, as much may be ſaid of Gods power and mercy; whence yet to inferr any ſuperfluity in them, were very ridiculous. <hi>Satisfactio Chriſti non magis dicenda eſt ſuper flua, aut Theſaurus ab Eccleſia diſpenſandus, quia ſuâ naturâ poteſt ad illos extendi, ad quos non extenditur actu, quam miſericordia, aut potentia Dei.

So the infinite value of the ſatisfactory works and ſufferings of Chriſt, is as it were a naturall property of God man; and therefore we cannot ſay, that any of them be ſuperfluous, though they be not applied unto thoſe, unto whom they are appliable.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Argument may be framed thus: The bloud of Chriſt is of infinite price; and therefore every drop of it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cancell the ſins of the whole world. Chriſt therefore did endure much more, then was neceſſary for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man: and of his ſuperabundant ſatisfaction the treaſure of the Church principally conſiſteth.</p>

<hi>did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfy the juſtice of God for ſin, nor make a perfect reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us with God, but his obedience unto death.

Wherefore the Apoſtle calleth him Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>the mediatour of the new Teſtament through death for the redemption of tranſgreſſions.

We were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated &amp;c, now hath he reconciled in the body of his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſh through death, Col.</hi> 1.21,22. Now will they play the ſophiſters with Chriſts death, as with his bloud, and ſay, that ſome are redeemed <pb n="321" facs="tcp:168371:162"/>with one part, and others with another branch of his death. What can be more abſurd, then ſuch a diſtribution of the application of Chriſt's death? As all the elect conſidered <hi>joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> are redeemed by the whole death of Chriſt, ſo every one of them <hi>ſeverally,</hi> and <hi>apart. Paul</hi> is not ranſomed by one portion of his death, and <hi>Peter</hi> by another: But each of them by the ſame whole death, conſidered <hi>entirely,</hi> in <hi>all its kinds, members, and degrees.</hi> Now if by the ſcripture the whole death of Chriſt is requiſite for the redemption of but one ſingle ſoule, then it is but a curious and raſh preſumption ſo peremptorily to affirme, that but one drop of Chriſts blood, one teare of his eie, one drop of his ſweat is more then ſufficient for the ranſome of all mankind.</p>

That Chriſts ſufferings might be ſatisfactory, there was requiſite not only <hi>dignitas perſonae,</hi> but alſo <hi>gravitas poenae,</hi> not only the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of his perſon, but alſo a fulneſſe in his ſuffering; he was to ſuffer all the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>generall</hi> curſe and puniſhment due to ſinne, as touching the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and nature</hi> of them, not as

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Papiſts by joſt
<hi>conſequence</hi> impugne the all-fullneſſe of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, and merit, in their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ſaintlie
<hi>ſatisfactions, and merits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In their <hi>maintenance</hi> of the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of the ſaints: for this maketh Chriſts ſatisfaction imperfect, in that it addeth thereunto a ſupply of humane ſatisfactions.</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſay the Papiſts, the doctrine of the ſatisfaction of the ſaints is ſo farre farre from derogating any thing from the dignity of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, as that it rather maketh unto the greater honour thereof, becauſe it deriveth all our power of ſatisfying from his ſatisfaction. It is no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Gods Omnipotency, that he workes by ſecond cauſes; that in the acting of the greateſt miracles he makes uſe of his meaneſt ſervants. So it is no imbaſement, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an honour, and glory unto Chriſt's ſatisfaction, to have them advanced ſo farre, as that by vertue of them, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt are made in part ſatisfyers of divine juſtice, not in <hi>equality</hi> with Chriſt, but by
<hi>ſubordination to him.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Bellarmine tom.</hi> 3. <hi>de paenitentia lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. very gravely adviſeth us to take heed, <hi>that we doe not wrong the workes of grace, the members of Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whiles we thinke to ſtrive for the honour of Chriſt; for the diſparagement of the fruite redounds unto the roote: and the injury done unto the members, reflects upon the head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that notwithſtanding all this glozing, their doctrine of humane ſatisfactions doth eclipſe the dignity, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the force of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, will appeare by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up theſe two particulars. 1. that conſidering the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, humane ſatisfactions are needleſſe. 2. that they are injurious to the worth of Chriſt's ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>1. Preſuppoſing the all-fulneſſe, and infinite worth of Chriſts ſatisfaction humane ſatisfactions, are needleſſe, and cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; To what purpoſe ſhould any man light up a dimme taper and ſmoaky candle, when he hath the cleare and full light of the ſunne? If Chriſt's ſatisfaction be of infinite price, why then may it not ſerve for the expiation of the guilt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments? and if there be an all-ſufficiency in<pb n="323" facs="tcp:168371:163"/>Chriſts ſatisfaction, what need ours?</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſay they, mans ſatisfaction is needfull, not to
<hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> the want of Chriſts ſatisfaction, but to <hi>apply</hi> it unto us. It is one of the inſtruments ordained by God for the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts ſatisfaction unto us, unto the taking away of temporall puniſhments.</p>
            <p>That this is but an idle evaſion will appeare, 1. By a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſts ſatisfaction. 2. By the entireneſſe of the application thereof; and 3. by their owne reſtriction, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>1. By a <hi>compariſon of Chriſts</hi> ſatisfaction: and ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have urged by <hi>Ames Bell. enervat. tom.</hi> 3.
<hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 227. <hi>Satisfactio nova non magis requiritur ad ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem Chriſti applicandam, quam nova mors, redemptio, reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, ad mortem, redemptionem, &amp; reſurrectionem Chriſti applican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> A new ſatisfaction is no more required to apply the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, then a new death, redemption, reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is to apply the death, redemption, and reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. From the <hi>entireneſſe</hi> and <hi>indiviſibility</hi> of the application of Chriſts ſatisfaction. Chriſts ſatisfaction is applied unto a ſoule <hi>entirely, wholly, and at once,</hi> at leaſt for the ſame ſins, and not by parcels. But now they without any the leaſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Scripture, make two <hi>parts</hi> of the application of Chriſts ſatisfaction; Firſt, <hi>one</hi> by <hi>confeſſion, contrition,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Prieſts abſolution,</hi> to the taking away of the fault, and eternall puniſhment. 2. <hi>Another by ſatisfactory workes,</hi> to the taking away of the temporall puniſhments.</p>
            <p>3. By their owne
<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Biſhop telleth usthrough all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the uſe of Chriſts ſatis faction is to take away the guilt of ſin, and the eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that this we obtaine in the forgiveneſſe of our ſins. But now after thefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our ſins, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions remaine to be performed by us. If this be ſo; if the uſe of Chriſts ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, and the ſatisfactions follow after, how or to what uſe doe the ſatisfactions apply unto us the ſatis factions of Chriſt? As for example, Mr. Biſhop giveth a man abſolution before he dyeth: he hath thereupon his ſins forgiven him, and a releaſe from c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment; but yet being not as yet throughly ſcoured, to Purgatory he muſt goe. Now then in what fort, and to what end, doth Purgatory apply unto him the ſatisfaction of Chriſt? For the ſatisfaction of Chriſt medleth not with temporall puniſhments; he hath left the Kingdome of temporall ſatis factions, and the whole revenuethereof to the Pope. What doe we here then with applying the ſatis faction of Chriſt? Riddle this riddle he that can, for Mr. Biſhop eannot doe it.</hi> Abbot <hi>againſt Biſhop part.</hi> 2<hi>d. pag.</hi> 737, 738.</note> limitation and reſtriction of the uſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction. They limit and reſtraine the uſe of <pb n="324" facs="tcp:168371:164"/>Chriſts ſatisfaction unto the taking away of the fault of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſins, and the eternall puniſhment of them. And how then can humane ſatisfactions apply the ſatisfaction of Chriſt for the taking away of temporall puniſhment?</p>
            <p>Unto theſe foregoing proofes, I ſhall adde <hi>foure</hi> more, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from 1. The <hi>generall nature.</hi> 2, The <hi>originall.</hi>
3. The <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution.</hi> 4. The <hi>relation</hi> of the inſtruments of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>1. From their <hi>generall nature:</hi> They are all
<hi>ordinances</hi> of God, branches of his worſhip. But the ſuppoſed paines of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which they make to be ſatisfactory to Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are not ordinances of God, branches of his worſhip: therefore, no meanes of applying Chriſts ſatisfaction to us.</p>
            <p>2. From their <hi>originall.</hi> All inſtruments of applying the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, proceed from the grace, mercy, and favour of God. But the paines of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and we may ſay the ſame of all temporall puniſhments, that are <hi>properly and formally ſuch,</hi> come from the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, and are of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and malignant nature, tending unto the perdition of the creature: and therefore not meanes of applying Chriſts ſatisfaction unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from their diſtribution: They are either on Gods part offering, or on our part receiving Chriſts ſatisfaction. But by humane ſatisfactions v. gr. the paines of Purgatory, and the like, Chriſts ſatis faction is neither offered on Gods part, nor received on our part: therefore they are no meanes of applying Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from <hi>their relation.</hi> All meanes of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death, are referred thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as the <hi>object,</hi> that is to be applied, and have an aptneſſe for the apprehenſion, ſignification, or exhibition thereof. But now no ſuch thing can be affirmed of the paines of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the like pretended ſatisfactory puniſhments: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have not ſo much as an inſtrumentall force of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death and ſufferings. I ſhall conclude this particular in the words of <hi>Abbot</hi> againſt <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> 2<hi>d. part. pag.</hi> 736, 737, <hi>Mr. Biſhop telleth us, that the<pb n="325" facs="tcp:168371:164"/>uſe of our ſatisfaction is to apply unto us Chriſts ſatisfaction. A goodly and witty device; I have a medicine fully ſufficient and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable for the curing and healing of my wound, and I muſt have another medicine for the healing of the ſame wound, which I muſt apply and lay to the former medicine. My ſurety hath fully and perfectly diſcharged my debt, and I muſt my ſelfe pay the debt againe, that my ſurety's payment may ſtand good for me. A ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to apply a ſatisfaction, is a toy ſo improbable and ſenſleſſe, as that we may thinke them miſerably put to ſhifts, that could find no better cloake to hide their ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The doctrine of humane ſatisfactions is injurious unto, and derogatory from Chriſts ſatisfaction; and that in <hi>two</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>1. It communicates unto man the power of ſatisfying, which is a
<hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>incommunicable prerogative</hi> of Chriſts.</p>
            <p>2. It aſcribes unto man ſatisfaction in ſuch a manner, as that it quite <hi>excludes</hi> and <hi>ſhuts</hi> as it were out of doores the ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. It <hi>communicates</hi> unto man the power of ſatisfying, which to be a peculiar and incommunicable prerogative of Chriſts may be manifeſted from <hi>two fruits</hi> of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and from a
<hi>compariſon</hi> of ſatisfaction with creation.</p>
            <p>1. From two fruites or effects of Chriſts
<hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> proper and peculiar thereunto. 1. <hi>Redemption of us,</hi> and 2. A <hi>perfect and full reconciliation with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Redemption of us.</hi> Chriſt redeemeth us from our ſins, by fully ſatisfying Gods juſtice for them; and therefore if the power of redeeming cannot be imparted unto the Saints; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the power of ſatisfying, becauſe redemption is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſatiffaction. Now the power of redeeming is ſo appropriate unto Chriſt, as that the very Papiſts themſelves acknowledge <hi>no Mediatours of redemption</hi> beſides him. He <hi>by himſelfe hath purged us from our ſins, Heb.</hi>
1.3.</p>
            <p>A ſecond effect of Chriſts ſatisfaction is our perfect and full <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Col.</hi>
1.21,22. Now theſe, and the like places, are to be underſtood
<hi>excluſively.</hi> We are reconciled unto God onely by the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death and bloud. The whole <hi>chaſtiſement of our peace
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:168371:165"/>was laid upon him, Iſ.</hi> 53.5. No chaſtiſement whatſoever, beſides that of his, can pacify the wrath of God againſt us, can procure our peace with him. And indeed the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will acknowledge, that nothing which a ſinfull man can doe, or ſuffer, is able to purchaſe a returne of Gods favour, and Friendſhip. Now if mens beſt workes, and greateſt ſufferings cannot reconcile unto God, then neither can they ſatisfy the juſtice of God. Becauſe reconciliation of God unto man followes ſatisfaction unto his juſtice; Even as his enmity with man is an inſeparable
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pemble. pag.</hi> 255.</note> conſequent of the breach of his juſtice: God then is never perfectly reconciled unto a creature, that hath violated his juſtice, untill full ſatisfaction be made unto his juſtice, for the whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due unto ſuch violation. And if he be once fully and perfectly reconciled, there is no place for any further puniſhment, though but temporall: Becauſe the friends of God, and members of Chriſt, cannot be condemned; But ſatisfactory puniſhments doe neceſſarily imply condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Where God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto ſinners, he doth not impute unto them the guilt of their ſinnes, but totally pardons them: He remits the whole fault, and puniſhment. <hi>He remembreth them no more: he doth not ſo much as make mention of them: He covereth them, makes them as white as ſnow; blots them out as a thick cloud; caſts them into the depth of the Sea; hides his face from them; caſts them behind his backe: removes them as farre out of his ſight, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt,</hi> ſo that upon judiciall enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſhall not be found, to wit, in reſpect of condemnation,

            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:168371:165"/>
               <hi>A ſecond argument</hi> to prove, that the power of lati-fying is not communicable unto a meere creature, is taken from a <hi>compariſon</hi> of <hi>ſatisfaction with creation.</hi> Satisfaction hath the ſame place in <hi>the order</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> which creation hath in <hi>the order of nature.</hi> But now creation is ſo proper unto God, as that it is blaſphemy to affirme, there be any
<hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate creators:</hi> And therefore it is equally blaſpheamous to averre, there be any <hi>ſubordinate ſatisfyers</hi> of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>As for that inſtance, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth of Gods working miracles by his ſervants, it is utterly impertinent: For God alone
<hi>really, and properly</hi> worketh miracles. Men being at the moſt but
<hi>morall cauſes</hi> of them: as by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they obtaine this of God, that he would doe them; or as God uſeth their helpe, as a ſigne or token of a miracle to be done by him. And moreover, new miracles were not done by man, for application of any former miracles of God; as they feigne, that our ſatisfactions ſerve to apply Chriſts. This ſimilitude therefore hath no proportion unto the matter in hand; And thus have we proved, that the power of ſatisfying is not communicable unto a meere man, much leſſe unto a ſinfull man, no not ſo much as in a way of <hi>ſubalternation.</hi> unto Chriſt's ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they aſcribe ſatisfaction unto man in ſuch a manner, as that they thereby quite exclude the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, as appeares by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his anſwere unto this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing argument of ours, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Purgatorio cap.</hi> 14. If Chriſts ſatisfaction be applied unto us by our workes, they are either <hi>two</hi> ſatisfactions, or but <hi>one:</hi> If they be <hi>two</hi> ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, one of Chriſts, and another of ours, then God ſhall be made unjuſt in puniſhing one ſin twice over; or if (as ſome ſay) the ſatisfaction be but one, then it is either Chriſts, and ſo we ſatisfy not; or ours, and ſo Chriſt ſatisfyeth not: or elſe we divide the honour with him, making him to ſatisfy for the fault, and we for the puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Unto this objection <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> having reckoned up two anſwers, pitcheth upon a <hi>third,</hi> which he takes to be the more probable: and it is, that <hi>there is one only ſatisfaction, and that is ours.</hi> Hereby you ſee Chriſt is quite excluded, at leaſt from making ſatisfaction for <hi>veniall</hi> ſins, as they call them, and temporall puniſhments.</p>
            <p>No ſaith <hi>Bellarmine: for it is by Chriſts ſatisfaction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we have grace to ſatisfy. He ſatisfyed immediately for the fault, and the guilt of eternall death, and mediately for the temporall puniſhment, in as much as he giveth us grace, whereby we our ſelves are enabled to ſatisfy God for it.</hi>

               <hi>he alwaies ſatisfieth, not by himſelfe, but by us. Then laſtly, he doth not ſo much ſatisfy for us, as in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Chriſt cannot be ſaid to ſatisfy, as he giveth unto men grace, enabling men to ſatisfy, any more then he can be ſaid to repent, or confeſſe ſins, as he giveth them grace for repentance, and confeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſecond place, the Papiſts doe <hi>covertly evacuate</hi> the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and infiniteneſſe of Chriſts merits by their doctrine of humane merits of <hi>condignity.</hi> To <hi>merit</hi> is to purchaſe that right unto a thing, which one had not before, to make that due, which was not due before. Now if the merits of Chriſt be of infinite value, they have purchaſed in the behalfe of his members a full right unto eternall life and happineſſe; ſo that their good workes do not make the ſame newly due. If they make it any way due, they make it due either in <hi>whole,</hi> or in
<hi>part:</hi> if in <hi>whole,</hi> then Chriſt hach merited nothing for them: if in <hi>part,</hi> then there is ſomething in eternall life, which Chriſt hath not merited. Either way there is a manifeſt derogation from the merits of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yea but the Papiſts beare us in hand, that their doctrine of merits doth not obſcure, but rather illuſtrate the glory of Chriſts merits: and to make this good, they have <hi>two devices;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> received generally by moſt, if not by all of them; The
<hi>ſubordination</hi> of the ſaints merits unto Chriſt's merits. The
<hi>ſecond</hi> is the peculiar ſhift of ſome few; The <hi>union of the ſaints perſons with Chriſts perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt, <hi>the ſubordination of the ſaints merits unto Chriſts merits.</hi> Our merits (ſay they) are derived from Chriſts: for he merited for us the power and grace of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and therefore our merits argue no inſufficiency in, but rather a wonderfull efficacy of his merits. It is no blemiſh unto the Sun, that the Moone and Starres ſhine with a light borrowed from it. The fruitfulneſſe of the branches is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement unto the vine. The dependant and ſubordinate efficiency of ſecond cauſes is no detraction from the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and all-ſufficiency of the firſt cauſe. And why ſhould it be any impeachment unto Chriſts merits, to affirme, that he doth not onely merit for us himſelfe, but alſo makes us able to merit?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:168371:167"/>Unto this fancy I ſhall oppoſe theſe
<hi>three conſiderations,</hi> that it is 1. <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrounded on Scripture.</hi> That Chriſts merit hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed unto us grace enabling for performance of good works, we deny not; but that he hath merited, that we might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a thing unheard of in the writings of the Prophets, and Apoſtles: and therefore to be rejected, not only as a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but alſo as a preſumptuous fiction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is alſo an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary fiction.</hi> For if Chriſts merits be ſo ineſtimable, as that they merit for us perfection, and fulneſſe of happineſſe and ſalvation, what neceſſity is there that we our ſelves ſhould merit this againe. If a thing be already done ſufficiently, it is more then is needfull for to doe it over againe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> this <hi>ſubordination</hi> of the merit of our workes unto Chriſts merits, is a thing <hi>utterly Impoſſible,</hi> as may be proved from <hi>four</hi> particulars conſiderable in our good workes. 1. Gods <hi>donation</hi> of them <hi>unto us.</hi> 2. <hi>Our Obligation unto them.</hi> 3. <hi>The imperfection and pollution of them.</hi> 4. <hi>The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between them and eternall life.</hi>

Now there can be no ſuch matter between God and man, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we receive of God, &amp;c. whatſoever good workes we have before done for it, yet we receive the ſame rather of Gods liberality, then of the debt of the worke. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he alleadgeth for this is; becauſe all that we are, and all that we have, whether good habits, or good acts, or the uſe of them, is wholly, and altogether from the bounty of God, freely both giving and preſerving them. And for as much as no mans free gift can bind him to give more, but he that receives more is the more bound to him, that gives it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hence it followes, that by the good habits and deeds, which God hath enabled us to doe, he is not bound by the debt of his juſtice to give us more; that he ſhould be unjuſt, if he gave it not; but we rather are bound unto him: and it is raſhneſſe, yea blaſphemy to thinke or ſay the contrary.</hi> And at laſt upon all this, he inferreth this concluſion:
<hi>ſiquid pro bonis operibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, nobis datur, vel redditur, potiùs &amp; principaliùs eſt ex li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitate dantis, quam ex debito noſtri operis.</hi> If God give any reward unto our well-doings, this is not, becauſe he is a debtour to our workes, but rather of his owne liberality.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond Argument,</hi> that our beſt workes are uncapable of merit, and conſequently, that the ſubordination of our merits unto Chriſt's, is impoſſible, is <hi>our obligation unto them.</hi> We are bound to fulfill the law in all perfection. The beſt of workes, the higheſt degree of obedience is but our due debt by Gods command. Now the payment of due debts, the performance of our dutie unto God, can merit nothing at his hands,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> argument proving that our good workes are uncapable of having any power of meriting derived unto them, is their ſinfull
<hi>imperfection,</hi> and pollution. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as menſtruous, and as filthy rags, Eſay.</hi> 64.6.<pb n="332" facs="tcp:168371:168"/>All our graces are imperfect; all our duties are polluted: and therefore ſtand in need of favour, grace, and mercy for acceptation. Nay they are ſo farre from meriting heaven, and eternall life, as that they ſupererogate for hell, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt argument is the vaſt
<hi>diſproportion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our good workes, and eternall life: For</p>
            <p>1. Eternall life, and happineſſe, is <hi>objectively</hi> infinite, as being the viſion, and fruition of God, an infinite good, unto it therefore nothing, that we can doe, or ſuffer, can be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
            <p>2. Our future life, and happineſſe, is infinite in point of
<hi>duration.</hi> But now ſaith <hi>Anſelme,</hi> a very ancient
<hi>Schooles man; if a man ſhould ſerve God a thouſand yeares with as great fervour and zeale as poſſible, he could not by way of condignity, merit to be in the king dome of heaven ſo much as for halfe a day.</hi> And thus (you ſee) that the derivation of merit unto our workes from Chriſt's merits is an utter impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>But there is one of their great Schoolemen <hi>Gabriel Biel in tert. ſentent. diſp.</hi> 19. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 5. that ſpeakes yet farre more diſhonourable of Chriſt's merits: For he
<hi>aſcribes merit unto our workes in a way of equality with Chriſt. Though the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be the principall merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which the grace of God, &amp; the opening of heaven, and the glory thereof be given, yet it is never the ſole or totall meritorious cauſe. Becauſe alwayes with the merit of Chriſt there concurreth ſome worke, as the merit of congruity,</hi> or <hi>condignity of him, that receiveth grace or glory, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is <hi>in terminis</hi> affirmed, that the paſſion of Chriſt is not a ſolitary, totall, meritorious cauſe: and the reaſon alleadged is; Becauſe there is farther requiſite the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our merits: therefore, by conſequence it is affirmed, that our ſuppoſed, or pretended merits, are conjoyned with Chriſt's in a way of coordination. Becauſe a totall, or ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe excludes onely coordinate, and not ſubordinate cauſes.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſhift, that <hi>Hoſius, Cajetan,</hi> and others, mentioned by <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> have, to cleare this their doctrine of merit
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:168371:168"/>from diſhonouring of Chriſt's merits, is the union of the godlie with the perſon of Chriſt; Whence there redounds unto their good workes a greater worthineſſe of eternall life, then of themſelves they would otherwiſe have. They are knit unto Chriſt, as members unto the head, as branches unto the vine; and ſo are as it were reputed one perſon with Chriſt. And conſequently their actions and good workes, their merits, are looked upon, as the actions, good workes, and merits of Chriſt himſelfe: For Chriſt hereupon, as an head, hath an influence upon them as members, and ſo worketh, and meriteth in them. Whereupon Every godly and righteous perſon may not onely ſay with the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. But alſo I merit, yet not I, but Chriſt meriteth in me. And to prove all this, they alleadge a ſaying rife in their Schooles, <hi>That our workes beſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the merits thereof, doe become worthy of heaven, and it's happineſſe,</hi> and this ſaying they might perhaps ground upon
<hi>Revel.</hi> 7.14. Where it is ſaid of the ſaints, <hi>that they waſhed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the lambe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Vaſquez</hi> hath ſared us the labour of confuting this evaſion, <hi>In primam ſecundae tom:</hi> 2 <hi>diſp.</hi> 214.
<hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 810. <hi>Good workes</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>receive their value, and worthineſſe from the perſon immediatly, and formally productive, or elicitive of them; and not from the perſon giving grace, and aſſiſtance for the performance of them: and therefore our good workes have noe worthineſſe of deſert, or increaſe thereof, derived from the worthineſſe of Chriſt, our head;</hi> and this he doth not barely dictate but prove <hi>by three reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Otherwiſe it would follow, that our workes were of infinite value; Becauſe Chriſt, from whoſe grace they proceed, is of an infinite dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Our good workes would be condignly meritorious of juſtification for others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Thirdly, they would merit in the utmoſt rigour of juſtice according unto not onely a proportionall, but alſo an abſolute equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between the merit, and the reward:</hi> Which are things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by thoſe Papiſts, that are yet moſt rigid and ſtiffe
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:168371:169"/>patrons of the merit of our beggarly, and polluted obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared the doctrine of the All-fulneſſe, and infiniteneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and merit, from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts both abuſe and oppoſition of it; I ſhall in the next place proceed unto ſome <hi>practicall</hi> application of the point: It may ſerve as <hi>a motive unto humiliation,</hi> and as <hi>a ground of conſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then here is a <hi>motive unto humiliation for ſinne:</hi> for the fulneſſe of its obliquity, and infiniteneſſe of its guilt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, is ſufficiently, and clearely demonſtrated from the fulneſſe, and infiniteneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction for it: And therefore there is nothing, that can with halfe that juſtice challenge ſuch a deepe meaſure of our teares, and ſorrow, as they. O the ſpots and blemiſhes of our Originall Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and actuall tranſgreſſions, muſt needs be filthy beyond all expreſſion, ſeeing nothing could waſh them away, but the unvaluable bloud of the immaculate lambe of God. There was no ſatisfying of Gods juſtice for them, appeaſing of his wrath againſt them, no redemption of our ſoules from them, no poſſibilitie (if we ſpeake in order unto Gods <hi>ordinate power</hi>) of the healing of them, but by ſhedding the heart bloud of him, who was over all God bleſſed for eve; by his obedience, that reached even ſo farre, as a cheerfull ſubmiſſion unto a moſt painefull and ignominious death. And from this now, let us thus aggravate the hainouſneſſe of our ſinnes. Surely they muſt needs infinitely diſpleaſe, and provoke God, ſeeing he expects ſo ample a recompenſe for them. The ſtench of them muſt needs be extreamly noyſome, and offenſive unto the noſtrils of God: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could quiet and appeaſe him, but that coſtly perfume, of which the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>His ſon giving himſelfe for us an offering, and ſacrifice to him, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> O that thraldome muſt needs be moſt miſerable and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, from which there is no ranſome, but by ſo ineſtinable a a price. Thoſe diſeaſes are deadly, unto the healing of whic, there is requiſite ſo precious, and divine a medicine. Thoſe wounds muſt needs be deepe, and dangerous, unto the cure of<pb n="235" facs="tcp:168371:169"/>which, there is neceſſary ſo rich a balſome, as out-weighs in worth millions of worlds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This fulneſſe of ſatisfaction and merit in Chriſt's humiliation is a ground of conſolation: for from it we may inferre 1. <hi>a perfection</hi> of <hi>his office,</hi> that he aſſumed for us. 2. <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his influence</hi> upon us.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>perfection of</hi> his <hi>office,</hi> that he aſſumed for us, <hi>the Captaine of our ſalvation was made perfect through his ſufferings Heb.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi>
8, 9. that is, as touching his office.</p>
            <p>1. Such was the worth of his ſufferings, as that by them he accompliſhed, finiſhed, an fulfilled that worke, which he was to performe for us, here on <hi>earth;</hi> a full ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice, a perfect expiation of our ſinnes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.32. <hi>John.</hi> 17.4.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was by his ſufferings perfectly, and fully qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and fitted for diſcharge of thoſe duties, that are to be done
<hi>in heaven</hi> for us. He was by them qualified, as with
<hi>compaſſion</hi> towards us, ſo with <hi>merit</hi> towards his father. As his owne <hi>experience</hi> of ſufferings was a motive <hi>unto ſympathy</hi> with us; ſo the <hi>value</hi> of his ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was an argument of prevalency with his father. If he aske for the pardon of any ſinne, he can plead, that he hath fully ſatisfied God's juſtice for it. If he crave for any mercy, favour, grace, in the behalfe of his members, why he hath paid for it unto the utmoſt farthing. An interceſſion that is backt with an infinite merit muſt neeeds be very forcible, and prevailing.</p>
            <p>2. From this fulneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and merit, we may inferre <hi>a perfection of Chriſts influence upon</hi> us. It is ſaid of the <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices</hi> under the law, that they could <hi>not make him, that did the ſervice, perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience, Heb.</hi> 9.9. Now this is ſpoken of them, as compared. with the ſacrifice of Chriſt, in a <hi>compariſon of diſſimilitude</hi> The deny all then of then ſufficiency to
<hi>perfect</hi> in things concerning the conſcience, <hi>implieth,</hi> that the ſacrifice of Chriſt is ſufficient to pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fect the conſcience, to <hi>purify</hi> it, and
<hi>pacify it,</hi> to <hi>enable it</hi> for the regular performance of all its offices. It can put both into our hearts, and mouthes, the <hi>anſwere of a good, conſcience towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>By one offering<pb n="336" facs="tcp:168371:170"/>he hath perfected for ever them, that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14. He hath perfected them for ever, as a <hi>morall cauſe</hi> in <hi>the way of ſatisfaction and merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He hath perfected them <hi>ſatisfactorily.</hi> He hath fully ſatisfied Gods juſtice for all their ſinnes, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.7.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. and for all things conſiderable in their ſinnes, for the fault in the offence of Gods majeſty, and violation of our friendſhip with him, the ſtaine, or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, all puniſhments for ſinne, whether eternall, or temporall; ſo that they are freed from the whole curſe of the law <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. and totally exempted from any condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation whatſoever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Sprinkling of bloud ſeven times, was required upon ſeverall occaſions under the law: As in the ſin offering for the ignorance of the anointed Prieſt

<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2,3. and therefore this ſprinkling of bloud ſeven times fitly ſerved to typify, that the bloud of ſprinkling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. perfectly, and fully cleanſeth our ſoules from all ſinnes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our conſciences from all dead workes to ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi>

                  </gap>all removall</hi> of our ſinnes from us in a way of remiſſion by the all-ſufficient ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, was typified by the
<hi>Scape-goate, that did beare upon him all the iniquities of the Children of Iſrael unto a land not inhabited, a land of ſeparation, Levit.</hi>
16.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath by the offering of himſelfe perfected them that are ſanctified, <hi>meritoriouſly.</hi> He hath purchaſed for them not only <hi>a poſſibility,</hi> but alſo a <hi>certainty</hi> of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He hath not onely by his merits opened the gate of heaven, made ſalvation poſſible unto all that believe, but further procured in the behalſe of all the elect, an actuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into glory: for he hath merited for them faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, regeneration, perſeverance, all gifts and graces that are abſolutely neceſſary, and will infallibly bring unto ſalvation; <hi>all things that pertaine to life and godlineſſe,</hi> 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peare was laid upon him, Eſay</hi> 53.5. the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement that was laid upon him was of ſuch worth, as that<pb n="337" facs="tcp:168371:170"/>it was ſufficient to purchaſe a through, and perpetuall peace, full favour, and perfect reconciliation with God. And a peace with the God of heaven is an <hi>ample ſecurity,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt an unceſſant warre, with all the Divels in hell, againſt the greateſt enmity, and rancour, the moſt powerfull oppoſition of wicked men on earth; and withall an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and undoubted pledge of all ſuch favours, priviledges, honours, and dignities, as favourites may expect from ſo roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and munificent a maſter, as the King of kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>
            <p>Of this perfection of Chriſts influence, that I have ſpoken of, we have in the remainder of the words an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; 1. from the extent thereof, in regard of <hi>continuance;</hi> 2. from a <hi>reſtraint</hi> thereof, in reſpect of <hi>object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>extent</hi> thereof, in regard of <hi>continuance. By one offering he hath perfected them that are ſanctified for ever.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> tranſlated, <hi>for ever,</hi> may be referred either unto the <hi>duration of the world,</hi> or elſe, the
<hi>duration of theſe</hi> that are ſanctified.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the duration of the world.</hi> Chriſts oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe perfects thoſe that are ſanctified in all ages of the world. It is an in exhauſt fountaine, the ſatisfaction and merit of which will never be drawne drie. As the ſunne enlightens all men, having the uſe of ſight, that ever were, are, or ſhall be in the world. So Chriſts ſacrifice being of infinite merit, perfects all thoſe, that ever were, are, or ſhall be ſanctified unto the end of the world. Indeed of it ſelfe, it is ſufficient for the perfection of even infinite millions of worlds. This perpetuall efficacy of Chriſts death was typified under the law by the caſting of Cedar wood into the midſt of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heifer, of whoſe aſhes was made the water of ſeparation, and purification for ſinne, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.6. Now of this, Cedar was a very meete type, becauſe it is a firme, and durable wood, that never rotteth.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>For ever</hi> may be referred unto the <hi>duration of thoſe,</hi> that are ſanctified; and ſo it denoteth the
<hi>perſeverance</hi> of this influence upon them: It is not for a time only, but unto the end of their lives, indeed unto all eternity; It keeps
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:168371:171"/>them by the power of God through faith unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> you have the <hi>reſtraint</hi> of this
<hi>influence</hi> unto them, that are ſanctified, both by infuſion of habituall grace, and holineſſe from God, and alſo by dedication, and conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as veſſells of honour unto God, as by Gods decree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſo by their owne ſtedfaſt purpoſe and reſolution. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified and unrenewed perſons then, dogs and ſwine, who are not as yet ſeparated out of the world, but proſtituted unto the vanities thereof, whoſe ſoules are deſtitute of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſanctifying graces, and defiled with innumerable luſts and corruptions, that are unmortified, who are utterly neglective and contemptuous of Gods ordinances, groſſe and impenitent profaners of his worſhip, can expect no ſhare in, comfort or benefit by the fulneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction and merit.</p>
            <p>Unto this place we may adde another in the ſame booke,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. <hi>being made perfect, he became the author of eternall ſalvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> In which words we have, 1. The

            <p>The <hi>ground</hi> of it: <hi>Being made perfect,</hi> to wit,
<hi>by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> as appeareth by compariſon of the words with the foregoing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. By his ſufferings he was perfectly qualified, and fully fitted for diſcharge of this great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the purchaſing of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>manner</hi> of this <hi>influence.</hi> He was not the

<hi>author of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>effect.</hi> It was not only <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but

            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>extenſion</hi> of this influence in regard of

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:168371:171"/>no impediment unto the all-powerfull influence of Chriſts merits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we have the <hi>reſtriction</hi> of this
<hi>influence</hi> in regard of <hi>object. He became the author of eternall ſalvation,</hi> onely <hi>to them that obey him,</hi> to wit, with the obedience of faith, and with new obedience, the obedience of good workes and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Children of diſobedience,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who will not be perſwaded, will not hearken unto divine admonitions, though never ſo perſwaſive, who are refractory, obſtinate, and impenitent in their diſobedience and rebellion, are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by quite excluded from the ſweet, and comfortable influence of Chriſts ſufferings, though in themſelves infinitely ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and meritorious.</p>
            <p>But this perfection or fulneſſe of Chriſts influence upon his members, we have ſet down, as here in theſe places,
<hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> in it ſelfe; ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
<hi>comparatively,</hi> as compared with the influence of Adam upon his off-ſpring. <hi>Adam was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or type of him that was to come, verſ.</hi> 14. to wit, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in reſpect not of ſuch things, as were <hi>perſonall</hi> unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, but of <hi>that</hi> which is by them <hi>communicated</hi> unto <hi>many.</hi> As Adam was a <hi>head, root,</hi> and <hi>fountaine</hi> of ſin and death unto the
<hi>univerſality of men,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt was a head, root, and fountaine</hi> of righteouſneſſe, grace, and life unto the
<hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality</hi> of Believers. But now to prevent all miſtaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he proſecutes the <hi>compariſon</hi> of ſimilitude between their influences, he firſt premiſeth the great <hi>diſparity</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and this he firſt <hi>affirmeth;</hi> and then
<hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He <hi>affirmeth</hi> it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. but <hi>not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift.</hi> But he doth not content himſelfe with affirming it once, but repeates it againe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.
<hi>And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift.</hi> The repetition was perhaps to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the great weight of the points handled, as alſo to import the more then ordinary incredulity that is in men generally touching them. There is nothing almoſt in Divinity goes down more hardly with fleſh and bloud, then the imputation of Adam's ſin and Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Having thus earneſtly <hi>affirmed</hi> this diſparity, he in the next<pb n="340" facs="tcp:168371:172"/>place, as ſtrongly demonſtrates it; and that firſt <hi>generally,</hi> ſecondly <hi>particularly,</hi> by inſtancing in ſome particular heads of <hi>diſparity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Then in generall,</hi> he proves this diſparity by way of
<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> by arguing from the leſſe unto the greater,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>For if through the offence of one, many be dead: much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> In which words <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> is underſtood his favour and love; and <hi>by the gift of grace,</hi> is meant the obedience of Chriſt, mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 18,
19. which as <hi>Beza</hi> noteth in relation unto God, is tearmed the <hi>gift by grace,</hi> or the free gift, becauſe it is by him freely, or graciouſly imputed to us: <hi>in relation unto us,</hi> it is ſtiled
<hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, verſ.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe by it, imputed to us, we are made righteous, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. Now this is here far advanced above the offence, fall, diſobedience, or tranſgreſſion of Adam, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of fulneſſe of efficiency. If that hath abounded, this hath
<hi>much more abounded,</hi> much more overflowed. It is a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor</hi> taken from rivers, that overflow their bankes. This <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, ſuperabundancy</hi> of Chriſts obedience unto Adam's diſobedience, in
<hi>point</hi> of efficacy, may be demonſtrated from the <hi>inequality</hi> that is between them, in regard 1. of <hi>their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Nature.</hi> 2.
<hi>Efficient.</hi> 3. <hi>Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>From the inequality</hi> that is between them, in regard of their <hi>generall nature.</hi> The offence, or diſobedience of Adam was
<hi>privative;</hi> Chriſts obedience or righteouſneſſe is
<hi>poſitive;</hi> and therefore more available and forcible unto ſalvation, then that unto condemnation. This is an argument urged by
<hi>Pareus,</hi> but I ſhall lay no great ſtreſſe upon it.</p>
            <p>But proceed unto a ſecond inequality that is between them, in regard of <hi>efficients.</hi> The diſobedience of Adam was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of a meere man; The obedience and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt was the obedience and righteouſneſſe of him, that was God as well as man: and therefore the merit of it infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurmounted the demerit of Adams ſin; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was more able to juſtify and ſave, then this to condemne and deſtroy. If you will derive Adams ſin higher, from the Devill, even yet he was but a creature, and ſo infinitely ſhort
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:168371:172"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, who was <hi>God man:</hi> And hereupon we may conclude, that there is more vertue in him, the <hi>ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by way of eminency,</hi> then there was venome in the head of the ſerpent: He is more able to heale ſoules, then Satan to poyſon and infect them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> inequality between them is in reſpect of their
<hi>effects;</hi> in regard of their <hi>excellency, difficulty,</hi> and
<hi>certainty of eveniency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Excellency.</hi> By Chriſt's obedience we are reſtored unto greater mercies and priviledges, then ever we were deprived of by Adam's diſobedience: Unto <hi>gifts without repentance,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. Conſtancy, &amp; irreverſibleneſſe in the juſtification of our perſons; ſuch a firmeneſſe in the ſanctification of our natures, as is unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the <hi>gates,</hi> that is, power, and policie <hi>of hell;</hi> ſuch an immortality of the body, in our reſurrection, as is not onely <hi>à poſſe non mori,</hi> a poſſibility of not dying, but a <hi>non poſſe mori,</hi> an impoſſibility of dying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The effects, purchaſed by the merits of Chriſt's obedience, ſurmount thoſe redounding unto mankind by the guilt of Adam's ſinne, in regard of <hi>difficulty.</hi> It is farre more difficult to build up, then to pull downe and deſtroy. There is more merit, and efficacy requiſite for the juſtification, and ſalvation of one ſoule, then there is guilt, and demerit for the damnation of millions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The effects of Chriſts obedience tranſcend thoſe of Adams diſobedience, in regard of <hi>certainty of eveniency.</hi> The actuall damnation unto which we are liable, by the fall of Adam, is preventable, and avoidable by faith, and repentance. Whereas the <hi>grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> inferreth a <hi>hypotheticall neceſſity</hi> of ſalvation, and ſo
<hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all poſſibilitie of damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtle proves the <hi>diſparity</hi> betweene the influence of Chriſt <hi>upon his,</hi> and the influence of Adam
<hi>upon his, particularly,</hi> by inſtancing in ſome particular heads of
<hi>diſparity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt head of diſparity</hi> is the difference between the<pb n="342" facs="tcp:168371:173"/>
               <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our guilt, and condemnation by Adam, and the <hi>Antecedents,</hi> or <hi>occaſions</hi> of ur juſtification by Chriſt. The condemnation accruing unto us from Adam is onely for one ſinne: the <hi>judgment was to condemnation by one, verſ.</hi> 16. that is, by one offence: One, <hi>for number,</hi> if we ſpeake of that firſt ſinne, committed by him in paradiſe, compleated in the eating of the forbidden fruite; One, <hi>for kind,</hi> if we ſpeake of that contracted from him, uſually called, Originall ſinne. But now our juſtification by Chriſt is a full abſolution, &amp; diſcharge not only from the ſin, which proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other perſonall ſinnes. <hi>The free gift is of many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto juſtification, verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſins,</hi>
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>It takes</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pareus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>away the cauſe, and the effect.</hi> It <hi>ſtops up not onely the fountaine,</hi> Originall corruption, <hi>but all the rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of</hi> actuall tranſgreſſion. The fulneſſe of ſatisfaction in the humiliation of Chriſt was like the fulneſſe of water in the ſea: And the ſea by reaſon of it's huge vaſtneſſe can drowne mountaines, as well as molehils. Even ſo the fulneſſe of Chriſt's ſatisfaction can ſwallow up the greateſt, as well as the leaſt ſinnes.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> head of <hi>diſparity</hi> is in regard of the <hi>potency,</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> of their <hi>effects.</hi> The offence of Adam brought in a kingdome, and tyranny of death. <hi>If by one mans offence death raigned by one, ver.</hi> 17. But now the obedience, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt hath purchaſed, and erected a farre more powerfull, eminent, and glorious kingdome, the Kingdome of life. <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall raigne in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt, ibid.</hi> It is very remarkable, that whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, in the former part of the verſe, <hi>by one mans offence death reigned by one,</hi> he doth not to anſwere this, ſay in the latter part of the verſe, life ſhall raigne by one man, Chriſt Jeſus; but, they <hi>which receive abundance of grace, &amp;c: ſhall reigne in life, by one,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. For this
<hi>Eſtius</hi> giveth two reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it ſounds more ſweetly and comfortably, to ſay, that juſtified perſons ſhall reigne by Chriſt; then to ſay, that life ſhall reigne in thoſe that are juſtified by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:168371:173"/>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is to put a difference between the Kingdome of death, and the Kingdome of life. The Kingdome of death deſtroyeth all its vaſſalls, but the Kingdome of life contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exalts all its ſubjects, and maketh them to be Kings, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the heavenly Kingdome with Chriſt. And thus have you ſeen out of the Apoſtle, that there is ſuch a wide imparity between the obedience of Chriſt, and the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Adam, as that the ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is by far more beneficiall unto the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, then the guilt of Adams ſin was prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Apoſtle proſecutes a <hi>compariſon of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi> between the efficacy of the ſin of the one unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and of the righteouſneſſe of the other unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and life. And this he doth firſt in <hi>proper,</hi> and then in <hi>metaphoricall</hi> tearmes.</p>
            <p>In proper tearmes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>As by the offence of one, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men unto condemnation: Even ſo by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life. For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> In which words we have the influence of Adams offence, and Chriſts righteouſneſſe reſembled in regard of both <hi>intenſiveneſſe and extenſiveneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Intenſiveneſſe:</hi> they are like, though not equall, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, or degree of their efficacy. As Adams offence was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to make his poſterity ſinners, to involve and inwrap them in guilt and condemnation: ſo Chriſts righteouſneſſe and obedience was available to inveſt all his members with juſtification, to make them righteous before God unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
            <p>2. They are reſembled proportionally in regard of the
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſſe</hi> of their <hi>objects.</hi> As by the offence of one, to wit, <hi>Adam,</hi> judgment came upon all men, that were his naturall ſeed, by propagation; Even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one,
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the free gift came upon all men, that were his ſpirituall ſeed, by regeneration unto juſtification of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:168371:174"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſimilitude is propounded in <hi>metaphoricall tearmes, ver.</hi> 21. <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reigne through righteouſneſſe unto eternall life, by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Whereas the kingdome of Originall ſinne is made the <hi>ſequel of</hi> Adams tranſgreſſion, So the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace is made the <hi>conſequent</hi> of Chriſts obedience.</p>
            <p>Originall corruption may be tearmed a King, in regard 1. of
<hi>vaſtneſſe of dominion.</hi> It reigneth before regeneration in
<hi>all men,</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> in their mortall bodies, as well as their ſoules. 2. In <hi>regard of greatneſſe of power;</hi> It hath all the powers of the ſoule, and parts of the body, untill they be renewed by the holy Ghoſt, under ſuch a command as the Centurion had his ſervants, or ſouldiers, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.9. And unto this kingdome of ſinne, the kingdome of grace by Chriſt is anſwerable. <hi>As ſinne reigneth unto death; ſo grace reigneth through righteouſneſſe by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now unto the grace, and favour of God, a kingdome an-anſwerably is aſcribed <hi>in two reſpects,</hi> 1. in regard of it's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull efficacy: it is as able to protect, and exalt all thoſe, to whom it is extended, as Originall ſinne is to ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe, that are under it's plenary ſubjection. 2. in regard of its plentifull fruits:
<hi>grace reigneth by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> By him there is a large kingdome, a great abundance of grace anſwerable to the kingdome, and abundance of ſinne in us, to the reigning of ſinne unto death. The ſubjects of this kingdome receive <hi>abundance of grace, and of the fruit of righteouſneſſe, ver.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more in the text, that much conduceth unto the glory of this kingdome of grace, and that is the <hi>continuation</hi> of it unto eternity. Other kingdomes may expire; <hi>But grace ſhall reigne through righteouſneſſe unto eternall life.</hi> And thus the Apoſtle declareth, what a great purchaſe Chriſt by his all-ſufficient merits hath made in the behalfe of his members. He hath purchaſed for them grace, and favour with the God of heaven; nay, a powerfull, rich, and an abſolutely eternall kingdome of grace. O how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and glorious ſhall all thoſe ſoules be that are found in Chriſt, ſtanding by faith, under the coverture of His merits,<pb n="345" facs="tcp:168371:174"/>and righteouſneſſe! <hi>Grace ſhall reigne</hi> over them <hi>through righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe unto eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt may be conſidered according unto his ſtate of exaltation, and ſo there dwelled in him an <hi>all fulneſſe of glory.</hi> There was a <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of the All-fullneſſe of glory, that was <hi>eſſentiall</hi> unto his Godhead: A <hi>reall collation</hi> of an all-fulneſſe of glory upon his manhood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, in the <hi>exaltation</hi> of Chriſt there was a <hi>manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of</hi> the all-fulneſſe, the infiniteneſſe of glory, that was <hi>eſſentiall</hi> unto the Godhead. This divine glory of his was for a time, as it were laid aſide, clouded, and eclipſed by the forme of a ſervant, the infirmities of his humane nature, the miſeries of his life, and by the ſhame, and paine of his death. But in his <hi>exaltation the father glorified him,</hi> according unto his
<hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>prayer, John.</hi> 17.5. <hi>with his owne ſelfe, with the glory, which he had with him before the world was:</hi> that is, the
<hi>father</hi> manifeſted, and diſplayed in him that glory, which he had from all eternity in a way of <hi>equality</hi> with himſelfe. By the reſurrection, he was <hi>declared to be the ſonne of God with power, Rom.</hi> 1.4. and therefore poſſeſſed of an infinite glory: for
<hi>the ſonne of God is the brightneſſe of his fathers glory, Hebr.</hi>
1.3. <hi>the Prince of life, Acts.</hi> 3.15. <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>But in a <hi>ſecond</hi> place, in the <hi>exaltation</hi> of Chriſt, beſides this <hi>externall declaration</hi> of the glory of his Godhead, there was farther a <hi>reall collation</hi> of an
<hi>all-fulneſſe of glory</hi> upon his manhood. It is generally reſolved by the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and for ought I know not gaineſaid by
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that Chriſt in regard of his ſoule was from the very firſt inſtant of his conception <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> bleſſed, full of glory: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the happineſſe of heaven for the ſubſtance of it. This <hi>Aquinas</hi> proveth, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 34.
<hi>art.</hi> 4. Becauſe even then he received grace, not by meaſure. But now, if his grace ſhould fall ſhort of that of comprehenſors, the ſaints, and Angels in heaven; If he ſhould not have enjoyed the light of glory; If his graces had not beene alwaies acted in the viſion, fruition, and comprehenſion of God, there had been a meaſure in his grace; The ſpirit had beene given unto him<pb n="346" facs="tcp:168371:175"/>by meaſure. Unto
<hi>Aquinas</hi> I ſhall adde <hi>Becanus,</hi> who upon the ſame argument thus reaſoneth. <hi>Sum. The. par.</hi> 3, <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.
<hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chriſt according unto his humanity had the cleare viſion of God from the very inſtant of his conception. The reaſon is, becauſe it is manifeſted that he had this viſion before his death: But the reaſon, and ground of his having of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, was the hypoſtaticall union. Therefore ſeeing this reaſon, or ground of the beatificall viſion agreed unto him from the very inſtant of his conception, therefore we muſt ſay, that he had the viſion of God from the firſt moment of his conception. The</hi> major <hi>is plaine from that in Joh.</hi>
3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came downe from heaven, even the ſonne of man, which is in heaven. Where the verbe,</hi> aſcendit, <hi>is of the preterperfect tenſe, whereby Chriſt ſignified, that he had now already aſcended into heaven, which could not be true of a corporall aſcent, but of a ſpirituall, by the beatificall viſion. The ſame thing may be gathered from that in John.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.</hi> And from <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father I will that they alſo, whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me. From theſe, and the like places it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Chriſt, when he ſpake theſe things, was in the eſtate of bleſſedneſſe, unto which he alſo wiſhed, and deſired, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles might come. Whence I conclude, that he was alwaies in that ſtate from the very inſtant of his conception, becauſe there is no reaſon why he ſhould be in it then, and not before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this heaven-happnieſſe, in the ſoule of Chriſt, from the <hi>beatificall</hi> viſion, there would alwaies, without Gods miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reſtraint, and prevention, have beene <hi>two,</hi> as it were
<hi>connaturall ſequels,</hi> 1. <hi>a fulneſſe of unſpeakable and unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> joy, ſolace, delight, pleaſure, and comfort in his ſoule, 2. <hi>a redundancy of</hi> glory from his ſoule unto his body. But by the ſpeciall diſpenſation of God, the reſultancy of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was ſuſpended, and withheld in the time of his paſſion; and the latter, the

               </note> derivation of glory from his ſoule unto<pb n="347" facs="tcp:168371:175"/>his body was totally deferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his Exaltation. And then indeed the <hi>interruption of</hi> joy in his ſoule, the <hi>interception of</hi> glory from his ſoule to his body, was altogeather removed.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His ſoule was filled</hi> with all that joy, ſolace, pleaſure, delight, and conſolation, which can poſſibly flow from the ſight of an object ſo infinitely pleaſing, as is the eſſence, majeſty, and glory of God. <hi>In the preſence of God he had fulneſſe of joye at his right hand pleaſures for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16.11. God made him <hi>full of joy with his countenance, Act.</hi> 2.28.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>His body</hi> was repleniſhed with as much glory, as was proportionable unto the moſt vaſt capacitie of the creature. It was
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a body of glory; that is, a moſt glorious body, in it <hi>ſelfe;</hi> and the ſpring of glory unto
<hi>others.</hi> Of this glory of Chriſts body <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> had a glimpſe in the <hi>transfiguration, Math.</hi> 17.2.
<hi>He was transfigured before them, and his face did ſhine as the ſunne, and his rayment was white, as the light.</hi> Glory was coevall unto his ſoule from it's firſt creation, but the flowing of it unto his body was ſtope to qualifie him for the worke of our redemption: for that was to be wrought by ſuffering; and if his body had been glorified, it would have beene impaſſible, and could not have ſuffered. But now here at the preſent, by ſpeciall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God giveth way unto the redounding of glory from his ſoule unto his body; and this tranſitory glory was ſuch, as that it changed the naturall darkneſſe of his fleſh, and <hi>made his face to ſhine, as the ſun;</hi> nay it brake through the obſcurity of his rayment, and <hi>made it white, as the light. His rayment became ſhining, exceeding white, as ſnow: ſo as no fuller on earth can white them, Mark.</hi> 9.3.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>fulneſſe of glory</hi> that was conferred upon Chriſt, in his <hi>exaltation,</hi> there were diverſe <hi>prophecies, and types</hi> in the old Teſtament; moſt cleare, and pregnant

Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life: In thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at thy right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> In theſe words the Pſalmiſt propheſieth of the <hi>reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Chriſts <hi>body,</hi> and the
<hi>glorification</hi> of his <hi>ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>reſurrection of his body,</hi> and that he deſcribeth 1. in regard of the <hi>tearme from which.</hi> 2. In reſpect of the <hi>tearme unto which,</hi> it was.</p>
            <p>1. In regard of the <hi>tearme from which</hi> it was: It was a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from death and corruption.</p>
            <p>1. From death and the grave, by way of <hi>ſubvention</hi> and releaſe. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell:</hi> that is, my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conſidered in its mortall part, in the ſtate of the dead.</p>
            <p>2. It was a deliverance from corruption, that is, putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by way of <hi>prevention,</hi> and preſervation. <hi>Neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption:</hi> that is, to feele and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer rottenneſſe.</p>

<hi>glorification</hi> of Chriſts <hi>ſoule,</hi> conſequent unto the reſurrection of his body. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy; at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Which paſſage we have thus abbreviated in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Peter's quotation of it, <hi>Acts.</hi>
2.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</hi> Here we have the 1. <hi>Matter.</hi> 2. <hi>Meaſure.</hi> 3. <hi>Duration.</hi> 4. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of that glory, with which Chriſts ſoule, in his exaltation, was repleate.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>matter</hi> of it, joy, and pleaſures. The Apoſtle Peter ſpeaking of the imperfect and begun joy of Believers here in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:168371:176"/>this life, ſaith, it is <hi>unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The joy then of Chriſts ſoule in its glorified condition is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beyond all comprehenſion.</p>
            <p>2. Here is the <hi>meaſure</hi> or degree of it;
<hi>fulneſſe of joy.</hi> God hath promiſed to make all that truſt in him, <hi>to drinke of the river of his pleaſures, Pſalm.</hi> 36.8. But in the heart of his ſon Chriſt Jeſus, there is an ocean of joy. The
<hi>Spirit was given not by meaſure unto him, John.</hi> 3.34. And as the Spirit was the principle of his grace, ſo it was the fountaine of his glory, and therefore his glory, as well as his grace, was unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> here is the <hi>duration of this glory; pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> All his life long he was <hi>a man of ſorrowes, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with griefe, Iſ.</hi> 53.3. Towards his paſſion his ſoule <hi>was exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death, Math.</hi> 26.38. And in the dolefull time of his paſſion, that fearfull houre of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his ſorrowes were beyond meaſure, <hi>Math.</hi>
27.46. But for all this God made him ample amends in the eternity of his joy and pleaſures at Gods right hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we have the <hi>cauſes</hi> of this glory of Chriſts ſoule, the <hi>full viſion</hi> and the infinite power of God.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>full viſion</hi> of God. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſſe of Joy;</hi> which in <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.28. is thus varied.
<hi>Thou ſhalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The right hand, that is, omnipotency of God, elevating his ſoule unto this viſion, by the light of glory. <hi>At,</hi> or rather
<hi>by thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore. Jeſus was exalted by the right hand of God, Acts.</hi> 2.33.</p>
            <p>Unto this prophecy I ſhall adde three more.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 4.2. <hi>In that day ſhall the branch of the Lord be beautifull and glorious, and the fruit of the earth ſhall be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and comely,</hi> &amp;c. In which words, Chriſt (if we underſtand them of him in reſpect of his humanity) is called the <hi>branch of the Lord,</hi> in reference unto the <hi>active principle</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the holy Ghoſt, the power of the higheſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33.
<hi>The fruit of the earth,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>paſſive principle</hi> of his conception, the Virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>prophecy</hi> is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52.13. <hi>Behold my ſervant ſhall be<pb n="350" facs="tcp:168371:177"/>exalted and extolled, and be very high.</hi> In that nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto which he is my ſervant, he ſhall be exalted, and be very high. Here are divers tearmes of the like import, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up to expreſſe the unexpreſſible glory of Chriſts humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in its Exaltation.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>prophecie,</hi> which I ſhall mention, is
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.22,23. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will alſo take off the higheſt branch of the high Cedar, and will ſet it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high mountaine and eminent. In the mountaine of the height of Iſrael will I plant it: and it ſhall bring forth boughs, and beare fruit, and be a goodly Cedar, and under it ſhall dwell all fowle of every wing: In the ſhadow of the branches thereof ſhall they dwell.</hi> Here Chriſt, in regard of his Humiliation, was but a tender one, cropt off from a young twig. In his exaltation, he will be a goodly or ſtately Cedar, which God will plant upon a high mountaine, and eminent. In the <hi>mountaine of the height of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> that is, not only in the Church <hi>militant,</hi> which is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Gods <hi>holy hill of Sion, Pſalm.</hi> 2.6. But alſo in the Church <hi>triumphant,</hi> intitled <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>mount Sion, the city of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the heavenly Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the prophecies concerning Chriſts glory, concurre alſo the types of it. I ſhall inſtance but in a few.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Arke of the Teſtament</hi> was to be overlaid with pure gold, within, and without, and to have a crowne of gold round about it,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 25.11.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> alſo was to be overlaid with pure gold, the top thereof, and the ſides thereof round about, and the hornes thereof, and it was alſo to have a crowne of gold round about, <hi>Exod.</hi>
30.3. And all this may be to typify the plentifull glory, that was to be in Chriſts humanity. He was to be glorious within and without, he was to be covered and crowned with glory.</p>
            <p>Unto theſe two types of Chriſts fulneſſe of glory I ſhall adde a third; the garments of the high Prieſt, that were for
<hi>glory and beauty, Exod.</hi> 28.2.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.4. the high Prieſt was to weare in the day of expiation plaine linnen garments, and this figured (thinkes

               <hi>Aynſworth</hi>) the baſe eſtate of Chriſt here on earth. And why may not we ſay anſwerably, that his glorious and golden gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments typified his glorious eſtate in heaven.</p>
            <p>Theſe forementioned prophecies and types receive cleare light from expreſſe <hi>affirmations</hi> of Chriſts glory in the new Teſtament. <hi>Chriſt, after he had ſuffered, enter'd into his glory, Luk.</hi> 24.26. Where glory is, as it were, appropriated unto him, as the moſt <hi>eminent ſubject,</hi> and <hi>principall efficient</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He had as it were the <hi>monopoly</hi> of glory. All the glory in heaven was in ſome ſort his glory. <hi>God crowned him with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, Heb.</hi> 2.7. and <hi>ſet him at his owne right hand in heavenly places, Epheſ.</hi> 1.20. Where by <hi>placing of him at Gods right hand,</hi> is underſtood a conferring upon his humanity, as <hi>ſoveraigne authority,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>unſpeakable glory and dignity.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe places we may alſo refer all thoſe paſſages, that ſpeake of Chriſts exaltation: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>God gave him in all things the preheminence. Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>He highly exalted him, and gave him a name above every name. Epheſ.</hi> 1.21. <hi>and placed him far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come.</hi> All theſe, and the like Scriptures evidently hold forth, as a <hi>fulneſſe of office</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> ſo alſo a <hi>fulneſſe of glory and majeſty</hi> in Chriſt, as man. Chriſts manhood was exalted unto an higher degree of glory, majeſty, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the moſt glorious Saint, or Angell ever was, or ſhall be. Principalities, powers, mights, and dominions fall far ſhort of his glory.</p>
            <p>This doctrine concerning the all-fulneſſe of glory in the manhood of Chriſt, in its ſtate of <hi>exaltation,</hi> may be applied for

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>For refutation</hi> of the doctrine of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> touching the <hi>corporall preſence</hi> of Chriſts body in the Lords ſupper. For this doctrine of theirs by juſt conſequence makes Chriſts body of glory, or moſt glorious body, his impaſſible body, to be moſt <hi>inglorious;</hi> becauſe it affirmeth it under the formes of bread and wine to be obnoxious unto as execrable indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:168371:178"/>and obſcenities, as can be imagined; as for example, to be burnt by fire, to be blown away by the wind, to be vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſgorged by either a ſickly, or drunken communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, to be put in a dunghill, to be devoured by wormes, mice, dogs, or hogs, to paſſe through the guts or entrals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the draught. See farther of this <hi>Biſhop Morton of the inſtitution of the Sacrament of the bleſſed body and bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Chriſts fulneſſe of glory</hi> in his exaltation may ſerve for the <hi>conſolation</hi> of all his members, becauſe they may be confident of conformity thereunto: for God hath
<hi>predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be conformed unto the image of his Son, Rom.</hi>
8.29. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the image of his glory,</hi> as well as unto the <hi>image of his grace and croſſe.</hi> For <hi>if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him: if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne with him,</hi> 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2 11,12. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, the <hi>King,</hi> be crowned with glory and honour, he will beſtow a <hi>matrimoniall crowne</hi> of glory and honour upon his <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and every faithfull ſoule. It is ſaid of David, that the <hi>Lord had eſtabliſhed him King over Iſrael, and that he had exalted his Kingdome for his people Iſraels ſake,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.12. and therefore doubtleſſe his care was to promote the glory and happineſſe of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraell, as well as of his owne perſon and family. David was a type of Chriſt, and therefore we may ſay of Chriſt, that God eſtabliſhed him in, and exalted him unto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory for his people, his Churches ſake; and upon this we may conclude, that he will be carefull to make them glorious and happy, as well as himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This conformity of Chriſts members unto his fulneſſe of glory, is either <hi>inchoate</hi> here in this life, or elſe
<hi>conſummate</hi> hereafter in heaven.</p>
            <p>1. Then the ſaints here even in this life may enjoy a
<hi>begun,</hi> and <hi>imperfect conformity</hi> unto Chriſts glory; and this may be evinced from 1. the <hi>relations of it.</hi> 2. <hi>Gods promiſes of it,</hi> and 3. <hi>the ſaints prayers for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>relations</hi> of it. It had the relation of an end</p>
            <p>1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the miniſtery of Chriſt</hi> himſelfe here upon earth. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remaine<pb n="353" facs="tcp:168371:178"/>in you, and that your joy might be full, John.</hi> 15.11. <hi>John.</hi> 17.13.</p>
            <p>2. Unto the penning of the ſacred Scriptures. <hi>Theſe things write we unto you, that your joy may be full,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> unto the prayers of the Saints. <hi>Aſke, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full, John.</hi> 16.24.</p>
            <p>2. There are many gracious <hi>promiſes</hi> in Scripture of this <hi>inchoation</hi> of the Churches, and Saints glory here on earth: 2
<hi>Peter</hi> 1.10,11. <hi>If ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall. For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſter'd unto you abundantly into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Even here in this life we may have an entrance into Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory, that ſhall be everlaſting. And this entrance may be abundantly miniſter'd unto us, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes.</hi> The words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may <hi>primarily</hi> be underſtood of Gods honouring the materiall Temple, with the bodily preſence of Chriſt: hut we may put an enlargement upon them, and extend them unto the Spirituall houſe of God, his Church, which he filleth here in this life with the beginnings, and firſt-fruites of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36.7,8.
<hi>Thoſe of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, that put their truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of thy winges, ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drinke of the river of thy pleaſure. In Eſay</hi> 66.10,11. God promiſeth all the true members of the Church, all that <hi>rejoyce</hi> with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and are <hi>glad with her, all that love her, to ſatisfy them with the breaſts of her conſolation, that they may milke out, and be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the abundance of her glory. For thus ſaith the Lord: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will extend peace unto her, like a river, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 12. If the Church be in a diſtreſſed and perſecuted condition, as a meadow that is mowne downe, why Chriſt ſhall come like
<hi>raine upon the mowen graſſe, as ſhowers that water the earth, Pſ.</hi> 72.6. When ſhe lieth under reproaches and ſuffering, even then
<hi>a Spirit of glory ſhall reſt upon her,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. In his dayes, that is, under his goverment, <hi>ſhall the righteous flouriſh, and abundance of peace ſo long as the Moone endureth, Pſalm.</hi> 72.7.
<hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus, Phil.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:168371:179"/>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we have the Saints
<hi>prayers</hi> for theſe beginnings of glory, recorded in Scripture, and that both of <hi>petition,</hi> and <hi>thankſgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Petition. <hi>Now the God of hope</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the behalfe of the <hi>Romans</hi>) <hi>fill you with all joy, and peace in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 15.13. This petition doubtleſſe had a favourable and gracious reception. The leaſt that can be ſaid of it, is, that it is a ſufficient argument of not onely the <hi>poſſibility,</hi> but alſo
<hi>probability</hi> of the thing petitioned for. In it there are <hi>two things</hi> eſpecially remarkable, pertinent unto the argument in hand. 1. The <hi>matter,</hi> with which he praied that they might be filled, <hi>all joy</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> 2. An <hi>amplification</hi> of this
<hi>matter</hi> from its <hi>cauſes,</hi> to wit, <hi>inſtrument, end,</hi> and <hi>principall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then we have the <hi>matter,</hi> with which he prayed that they might be filled, <hi>all joy and peace:</hi> which
<hi>Synechdochically</hi> may be very well put for all other inchoations of glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe they ſome way or other imply them.</p>
            <p>1. Then he prayeth, that God would fill them with <hi>all joy.</hi> Now a Chriſtian hath all joy, that is, his joy is full and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, either in regard of <hi>objects, degrees,</hi> or
<hi>duration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then a Chriſtian hath <hi>all joy</hi> in regard of
<hi>objects.</hi> When he poſſeſſeth in ſome meaſure all the objects, that is, all the grounds or motives of a true Spirituall joy, when he hath for ſubſtance all that a believer ought to rejoyce for: when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers reach ſuch a happineſſe, their joy is full. <hi>John.</hi>
15.11. &amp; 16.24. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4. <hi>The joy of Chriſt is fulfilled in themſelves, Iohn</hi> 17.13.</p>
            <p>2. A Chriſtian may have all joy in regard of <hi>degrees,</hi> though not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> yet ſo far forth, as the meaſure of joy is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in this preſent life, which is but the <hi>ſeed time of joy: Pſ.</hi> 97.11. And indeed, I believe the heart of man during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode on earth, is hardly capable of a more overflowing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of joy, then that which ſupported the Martyrs, and made them laugh and ſing in their fiery trialls, their moſt bloudy perſecutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> a believer may have <hi>all joy</hi> in regard of <hi>duration.</hi> He<pb n="355" facs="tcp:168371:179"/>may, as the Apoſtle exhorts him
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>rejoyce alwaies</hi> in the ſtorme of the moſt violent oppoſition, as well as in the calme of peace and protection. The troubles and miſeries of this life may ſometimes dimme his joy, but they can never totally or finally extinguiſh it. <hi>Your joy</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>no man taketh from you, John</hi> 16.22. He might have ſaid no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Paul beſeecheth God in the behalfe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that as their joy, ſo their <hi>peace</hi> too may be full, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all peace:</hi> that is, with all ſorts and kinds of peace; the <hi>peace of concord</hi> towards their brethren, the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conſcience</hi> in themſelves, and that both <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>practicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Speculative,</hi> which was a freedome from ſcrupulous doubtings concerning things indifferent, of which he ſpake before.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Practicall,</hi> and that both of <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>peace of juſtification,</hi> which ariſeth from the aſſurance of pardon, and ſenſe of Gods favour.</p>
            <p>2. The peace of <hi>ſanctification,</hi> which proceedeth from the mortification of all luſts and corruptions. Such is the fulneſſe of this peace of believers, as that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, it <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding, Phil.</hi> 4.7. that is, it is incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any created underſtanding, ſave that of the humane nature of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the next place we have this <hi>full and univerſall joy and peace amplified</hi> from the <hi>cauſes,</hi> and that both
<hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>efficient cauſes</hi> thereof, and that againe both <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> and <hi>ſupreame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>ſubordinate cauſe</hi> thereof, <hi>faith: The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> that is, by believing. And indeed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is by the Apoſtle often uſed for <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after the propriety of the Hebrew. The influence of faith upon joy, you have in the Apoſtle Peter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>In whom, though now we ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> And as for its efficiency of peace, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<pb n="356" facs="tcp:168371:180"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> plainely expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.
<hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> faith is the <hi>ground</hi> of all true inward joy, and peace in our owne boſomes; and the <hi>boundary</hi> of all true, ſincere, and ſound joy, and peace with others.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second amplification is</hi> from the <hi>ſupreame,</hi> and <hi>firſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe: through the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nothing can fill a ſoule with all joy and peace, but the full, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power of the Spirit of God. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> may water; but Omnipotency only can reach ſuch an increaſe.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>amplification,</hi> which we have of this fulneſſe of joy, for which the Apoſtle is a ſuiter in the behalfe of the Romans, is the <hi>finall cauſe</hi> thereof: <hi>that ye may abound in hope. Pareus</hi> obſerveth, that there is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the
<hi>verbe,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; He doth not wiſh unto them barely hope, but to <hi>abound in hope:</hi> and to abound in hope, denoteth 1. <hi>a plenteous progreſſe in the degrees.</hi> 2. <hi>a fulneſſe of the objects.</hi> 3. <hi>a conſtant ſufficiency,</hi> in
<hi>reference to the uſe of hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A <hi>plenteous progreſſe in the degrees of</hi> hope, an arrivall unto a full aſſurance of hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>By which an entrance is miniſter'd unto us abundantly into the everlaſting kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>fulneſſe of the objects</hi> of hope. Some by this
<hi>aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in hope</hi> (ſaith <hi>Willet</hi> upon the place) underſtand the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for of all things needfull, both for the body, and ſoule.</p>
            <p>3. It <hi>denoteth a conſtant ſufficiency, as touching the uſe of hope.</hi> Looke as he may be ſaid to abound in money, or treaſures, who hath enough to ſerve his turne upon all occaſions, to ſupply all his wants: So a ſoule may be ſaid to abound in hope, when it hath ſuch a meaſure thereof, as is conſtantly ſufficient for a victorious encounter with the thickeſt variety of the greateſt perils, incident unto mankind. Our hope is then truely abundant, when it is an
<hi>helmet</hi> ſtrong enough to beare the blowes of our moſt powerfull, and malitious enemies: When it is an <hi>anchor</hi> ſure, and ſtedfaſt enough,<pb n="357" facs="tcp:168371:180"/>whereby the ſoule may ride it out ſafely in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tempeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Pauls petition</hi> for the beginnings of glory in the
<hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhall ſubjoyne his <hi>thankſgiving</hi> for the like in himſelfe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3,4,5. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them, which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God. For as the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſecond place, this <hi>conformitie</hi> unto Chriſts glory begun here in this life, and permixed with our infirmity, and miſery, ſhall hereafter in heaven be <hi>compleated</hi> and <hi>perfected:</hi> for then we ſhall have a full, and everlaſting fruition of all honour, and bliſſe, derivable from God, and proportionable unto our capacities. <hi>God will then make knowne the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, Rom.</hi> 9.23. Then he will reveale the riches of the glory of his <hi>inheritance in the ſaints, Epheſ.</hi>
1.18. David makes a large profeſſion of the inward gladneſſe of his heart, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſion thereof by his tongue: <hi>My heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth, Pſalm.</hi> 16.9. Nay, he expreſſeth, that the feare of death did not put a dampe upon his rejoycing; <hi>My fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall alſo reſt in hope.</hi> The hope of a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto a glorious, and immortall life, made him looke upon his
<hi>grave,</hi> as a <hi>bed, Eſay.</hi> 57.2. upon <hi>death,</hi> as a
<hi>ſleepe,</hi> or <hi>reſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. Now the ground of this his joy, and hope, was the reſurrection of Chriſt's body, and glorification of his ſoule, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11. But now this could never have begotten ſuch a joy, and hope, if he had not been aſſured to be made conformable thereunto. The life, and glory of all believers is bound up in Chriſt's life, and glory; as <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid, the life of
<hi>Jacob</hi> was bound up in <hi>Benjamins life, Gen.</hi> 44.30. <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God, Col.</hi> 3.3. therefore if God did not leave his ſoule, his perſon in <hi>ſheol,</hi> in the grave, in the ſtate of death, neither will he leave there the perſons of any, that belong unto him: Becauſe God did not ſuffer his<pb n="358" facs="tcp:168371:181"/>holy one, to ſee Corruption; therefore he will reſcue, and redeeme all his ſaints from corruption, and not ſuffer them to be finally overwhelmed therewith. He will deale with them, as he did with Chriſt, ſhew unto them the path of life,
<hi>make knowne unto them the waies of life, &amp;c. Pſalm.</hi> 16.11. Cauſe them to have in his preſence fulneſſe of joy, and at his right hand pleaſures for evermore; or make them full of joy with his countenance,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2.28. <hi>The glory, which thou gaveſt me, ſaith Chriſt, I have given them, Iohn</hi> 17.22. which words (to omit other interpretations that are impertinent unto our purpoſe, and leſſe probable) may be underſtood, either of the <hi>reall glory of his exaltation by God:</hi> or elſe of <hi>the glory of his relation unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of <hi>The reall glory of his exaltation by God:</hi> and then the meaning of the words is; that heavenly felicitie, unto which thou haſt predeſtinated my humanity, I have deſigned unto all thoſe, that believe in me; I have promiſed it unto them, and will purchaſe it for them; and give them, in way of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the firſt fruits, and taſt of it. Gods gift of glory unto Chriſt is irreverſible, and therefore Chriſt's grant of it unto believers, is irrevocable.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> the words may be underſtood of <hi>the glory</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>relation</hi> unto God, the dignity of his ſonne-ſhip. <hi>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the onely begotten of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iohn</hi> 1.14. This glory was given unto Chriſt, by
<hi>eternall generation,</hi> ſo that he is the naturall Sonne of God; &amp; believers unto whom Chriſt giveth this priviledge by grace, are ſonnes by grace, and adoption: and yet even this <hi>adoptive filiation</hi> is ſuch an unſpeakable honour, as that in compariſon of it, to be deſcended from the greateſt Potentate, that ever was in the world, is but to be baſely borne. If we take this ſence, it will alſo fit our preſent purpoſe: For what is the full glorification of the ſaints, but the manifeſtation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of their adoption? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. The fulneſſe of glory is that inheritance, unto which the faithfull are adopted and into the poſſeſſion of which they ſhall enter at the end of the world. And in this ſence is it, that their full glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtiled by the Apoſtle Paul their Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.<pb n="359" facs="tcp:168371:181"/>In <hi>Iohn.</hi>
17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24,25. Chriſt intercedeth for the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his glory unto all the elect. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me; for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world. O righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father, the world hath not knowne thee, but</hi> I <hi>have knowne thee, and theſe have knowne that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Here we have a
<hi>deſcription</hi> of the glory of believers, and an <hi>amplification</hi> of it from the <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and <hi>cauſes</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A deſcription</hi> of it. He makes it to ſtand in two things, a <hi>coexiſtence</hi> with Chriſt in heaven; a <hi>viſion,</hi> or <hi>intuition</hi> of his glory.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>coexiſtence</hi> with him in heaven. I <hi>will that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> As God, he was in heaven, even while he was upon the earth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. But he ſpeakes of himſelfe all along as man, and Mediatour; and he ſpeakes of his being in heaven, as a thing preſent, becauſe it was very ſhortly, and certainely to come to paſſe. Thus <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he makes proteſtation, that he had <hi>finiſhed the worke, which God gave him to doe;</hi> and yet, it was not finiſhed, untill he cried out upon the croſſe, <hi>it is finiſhed, John</hi> 19.30. <hi>Auſtin</hi> puts a difference between being <hi>where Chriſt is,</hi> and being <hi>with Chriſt.</hi> The damned in hell are
<hi>where Chriſt is,</hi> as God. But thoſe only are with him, that have a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him in his glory: As he ſaid unto the good thiefe, <hi>to day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe, Luke</hi> 23.43. But
<hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> rightly noteth, that no great ſtreſſe is to be laid upon this; becauſe that, which he tearmeth here <hi>a being with Chriſt,</hi> he ſtileth <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.26. a <hi>being where Chriſt is. Where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.</hi> However yet, the ſame <hi>Authour</hi> obſerveth, that to <hi>be with Chriſt,</hi> hath a greater <hi>force,</hi> and <hi>emphaſis,</hi> then to be <hi>where he is;</hi> becauſe it more expreſſely ſignifieth a participation of his glory, a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his inheritance and kingdome, a reigning togeither with him, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> particular, wherein the glory of believers is made to ſtand by Chriſt, is their <hi>viſion,</hi> and <hi>intuition</hi> of his glory. <hi>That they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me.</hi> Here<pb n="360" facs="tcp:168371:182"/>they have but a glimpſe of Chriſts glory: It ſhineth as it were through a ſmall chinke into a dungeon of darkeneſſe. It is a light, that ſhineth in a darke place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1.19. But in heaven they ſhall have a full aſpect of the ſplendour of his glory; For they ſhall <hi>ſee him as he is, Eſay.</hi> 1.32. <hi>face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. The ſight of this glory ſhall be of a transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nature: for if the imperfect beholding of his glory in the glaſſe of his goſpell change into the ſame image, into a growing glory,
<hi>from glory, to glory;</hi> why then the full view of his glory in heaven, will transforme into a fulneſſe of glory. The viſion, and intuition of his glory then doth amount unto a fruition of it. They ſhall be not bare
<hi>ſpectators,</hi> but alſo <hi>partakers</hi> of it. Thus to ſee the kingdome of God, and life, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. is to enjoy the kingdome of God, and life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have an <hi>amplification</hi> of this glory; and that from it's <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and <hi>cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From its <hi>ſubjects; primary,</hi> and
<hi>ſecondary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Primary,</hi> Chriſt. <hi>May behold my glory. Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory, Lu.</hi> 24.26. Glory is ſaid to be his in 4 <hi>regards.</hi> 1 in reſpect of his <hi>fathers donation. The glory, which thou haſt given me;</hi> to wit, by the decree of Predeſtination. 2. By his owne <hi>purchaſe: He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe; Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name, Phil.</hi> 2.8,10. 3. In regard of <hi>plenary participation.</hi> 4. in reſpect of <hi>originall,</hi> and <hi>primary poſſeſſion.</hi> Chriſt was poſſeſſed of a fulneſſe of glory for to diſtribute it unto his members.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, the head, is the <hi>primary,</hi> his members are the
<hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſubjects of</hi> this glory, unto whom it is diffuſed from him. <hi>I will that thoſe, whom thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c. And to be
<hi>given unto</hi> Chriſt, ſignifies the <hi>ſtate of</hi> Election: for it ſignifies a good, and happy ſtate, or condition, precedaneous unto effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall vocation, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All, that the father giveth me, ſhall come unto me.</hi> But to come unto Chriſt, is to believe in Chriſt by an effectuall Vocation. By this then you may gather, that none ſhall communicate in the fulneſſe of<pb n="361" facs="tcp:168371:182"/>Chriſts glory, but ſuch as the father hath given unto him by election; And they are ſuch, as in God's appointed time are drawne, and wrought over to come unto Chriſt, that is, to believe in Chriſt by an effectuall calling. None then can have a ſound confidence of their future glorification, that are not aſſured of their paſt election; and a well built aſſurance of election preſuppoſeth an aſſurance of vocation, and of comming unto Chriſt thereby; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his exhortation, 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. premiſeth the making ſure of their calling unto the making ſure of their election. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling, and election ſure.</hi> None can make their election ſure, that have not firſt made their calling ſure. Thoſe mens hopes therefore of glory are but raſh, and ungrounded preſumptions, who turne the deafe eare unto the call, and command of Chriſt, who ſtand of, and refuſe to come in, and ſubmit to his Regiment; but ſtick ſtill in their ſins without repentance, and wallow in that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, wherein the world lieth, 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond amplification</hi> of this glory, which awaits belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is from the <hi>cauſes</hi> of it, and that both <hi>moving,</hi> and <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>moving cauſes</hi> of it; (to ſpeake of God after the manner of men,) and the <hi>impulſive</hi> cauſes of it are either <hi>outward,</hi> or <hi>inward: outward</hi> Chriſts interceſſion: <hi>inward,</hi> 1. Gods love of Chriſt. 2. Gods righteouſneſſe. The <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive cauſe</hi> is a ſanctifyed, and ſaving knowledge of Chriſts miſſion.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>moving cauſes</hi> of it; and 1. with that which is <hi>outward,</hi> and <hi>procatarticke;</hi> Chriſts interceſſion. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will, that thoſe, &amp;c.</hi> It is not
<hi>voluntas imperantis,</hi> but <hi>optantis, &amp; rogantis:</hi> It is not a will of command, but a will of deſire, requeſt, and prayer; and God cannot but gratify Chriſt in all his petitions; He cannot but fulfill his will, and ſatisfy his deſires. Chriſt intercedeth for the future glory of his members, and therefore they cannot but be happy: for impoſſible, that the father ſhould deny him any thing, for which he is a ſuter,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 11.42.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inward,</hi> or <hi>proegumenall moving cauſes</hi> of the glory of<pb n="362" facs="tcp:168371:183"/>believers come next to be conſidered, 1.
<hi>Gods love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Gods righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then they have <hi>Gods love of Chriſt,</hi> as it were a pawne, and pledg of their compleate glory in heaven. <hi>Father I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, &amp;c. for thou haſt loved me before the foundations of the World.</hi> The ſumme of the words is, becauſe thou haſt loved me, the head, therefore glorifie them; my members; Thou hateſt all thoſe, whom thou doſt not glorifie, and hatred of the members is inconſiſtent with love of the head. If thou loveſt me, thou canſt not hate them: and therefore, as thou loveſt me, let them be where I am, and there participate in my glory. Can believers deſire greater ſecurity againſt the hazard of their bliſſe, and ſalvation. They cannot miſſe of heaven, and happineſſe, unleſſe there be a change in Gods affection unto his owne ſonne, whom as man, and our mediatour, he hath loved before the foundation of the world. That love of God then, which raiſed Chriſt from his grave, the ſtate of the dead, unto a throne and crowne at the right hand of the majeſtie on high, will alſo in due time exalt all believers unto a full conformitie unto his glory: It will place them with him in his throne, <hi>Revelat.</hi> 3.21. <hi>and kingdome,</hi> 2
<hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.12. and diſtribute unto them fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond <hi>impulſive</hi> cauſe of the glorification of thoſe, whom the father hath given unto the ſonne, is his righteouſneſſe, compared with the <hi>diſpoſitive cauſe</hi> thereof on their part, their faith, the condition of the new Covenant. <hi>O righteous Father, &amp;c. theſe have knowne that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> It is, as if he had ſaid, becauſe thou art righteous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thoſe, whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, and behold my glory; For in them there is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prerequired unto a full enjoyment of glory. They believe in me, and they know that thou haſt ſent me: And faith in Chriſt, which is often expreſſed by knowledge of Chriſt, is the prerequiſite of eternall life and glory, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Unto theſe then<pb n="363" facs="tcp:168371:183"/>compleatneſſe of glory is due, though not by debt of
<hi>deſert,</hi> yet by debt of <hi>promiſe.</hi> Therefore, though eternall life be the <hi>gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 6.23. yet it is alſo tearmed a <hi>crowne of righteouſneſſe,</hi> which the Lord <hi>the righteous judge will give,</hi> 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.8. And the reaſon of this appellation of it, is becauſe God by his promiſe hath bound himſelfe to give it, and in the performance of his promiſe, he is approved righteous. The righteouſneſſe then of God, that Chriſt here appealeth unto, in the behalfe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is <hi>juſtitia fidelitatis,</hi> Gods truth, and fidelity, in the making good of his word, and promiſe. Believers have the fidelity, and veracity of God engaged for their perfect, and compleate happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We have the diſpoſing cauſe of their glory.
<hi>Theſe have knowne that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Becauſe they have knowne <hi>this, let them be where I am, and there behold my glory.</hi> The knowledge of an object in ſcripture ever implieth ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table affections, and actions. To know Chriſt then is to believe in him, to adhere unto him, to imbrace, and love him, to obey him, &amp;c. To know that the father hath ſent him is, beſides the knowledge hereof, and aſſent hereunto, to accept Chriſt in regard of all thoſe offices, for the diſcharge of which he was ſent by the father; to depend upon him, as a prophet, for the declaration, and revelation of his father; to reſt upon him, as a prieſt, for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and acceptation of our perſons; to ſubmit unto him, as a king, for government, and guidance in all ſpirituals. Such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as this, is, though not a <hi>meritorious,</hi> yet a
<hi>diſpoſing cauſe</hi> of heaven, a neceſſary antecedent thereof, the way thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Our future happineſſe, and glory, is ſtiled in ſcripture the <hi>light of life, Iohn</hi> 8.12. <hi>the inheritance of the ſaints in light Col.</hi> 1.12. and therefore, what qualification or preparation for it more congruent, then the light of ſuch a knowledge, as we have deſcribed: By it, we are made meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the darkneſſe of Ignorance is a diſpoſition unto that other darkneſſe, which is in Hell. Thoſe, that doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of Chriſt here darkly in the glaſſe of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,<pb n="364" facs="tcp:168371:184"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. they are utterly unqualified for the diſtinct, clear, and immediate intuition of his glory in heaven, where he is ſeen face to face. The inheritance of the ſaints conſiſteth in light, and therefore perſons ignorant of God and Chriſt, are altogeather unmeete to ſhare in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay of them, whiles they are on earth, that they are in darkneſſe, and the ſhadow of death, in the borders, and ſuburbs of hell.</p>
            <p>This <hi>diſpoſitive cauſe</hi> of the glory of the elect, we have <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. (to goe no farther) <hi>illuſtrated</hi> by a
<hi>twofold compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> one of <hi>diſſimilitude,</hi> another of
<hi>ſimilitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By a <hi>compariſon</hi> of <hi>diſſimilitude. The world hath not knowne thee, and therefore I pray not for it; but theſe, that thou haſt given me, have knowne that thou haſt ſent me, and therefore I intercede for their glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By a <hi>compariſon</hi> of <hi>ſimilitude. I have knowne thee, and theſe have knowne that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> I have knowne thee, in all perfection, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi>
1.18. And theſe know my miſſion by thee, and therefore in ſome meaſure they know thee alſo: unto them only of all the ſons of men, have I revealed thee, and diſcloſed thy counſell; and therefore I am an earneſt interceſſour in their behalfe, that they may be with me, where I am, and behold my glory. I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated a ſaving knowledge of me, and thee, unto them, and therefore do thou impart glory, and happineſſe unto them. They are conformable unto me, while I am here on earth, and therefore let them conſort me in heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeake more particularly of the branches of this our conformitie after death, unto the fulneſſe of Chriſt's glory. It is 1. of our ſoules, preſently after diſſolution from their bodies. 2. of our bodies too, upon their reunion with our ſoules in the reſurrection.</p>
            <p>1. Of our ſoules, preſently upon their diſſolution from our bodies: <hi>Then the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect, Hebr.</hi>
12.23. perfectly freed from ſinne, and miſery. And if we ſpeake of their happineſſe, in regard of <hi>eſſentials,</hi> poſſeſſed of as great a perfection thereof, as is communicable unto <pb n="365" facs="tcp:168371:184"/>them. In their <hi>underſtandings</hi> there will be perfect light. <hi>They ſhall ſee God face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 12. <hi>they ſhall ſee Chriſt as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. In their <hi>wills</hi> there ſhall be love, and joy, flaming unto the higheſt. What the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Church in generall, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. is applicable unto every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoule, preſently upon ſeparation from the body; Chriſt forthwith preſents it unto himſelfe <hi>glorious, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpot, or wrinckle,</hi> or <hi>any ſuch thing, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the reſurrection Chriſts members ſhall enjoy a perfect <hi>ſtate of glory in their bodies,</hi> as well as their ſoules. This <hi>ſecond branch</hi> of their conformitie unto Chriſts fulneſſe of glory I ſhall ſet forth, and confirme by the explication of foure places of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according unto the working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi> In <hi>ſanctification</hi> there is a change wrought in both the bodies, and ſoules of the ſaints, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. But this is but an <hi>imperfect</hi> change. In their <hi>glorification</hi> after death, there will be a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> change, as of their ſoules, preſently upon their ſeparation, ſo of their bodies in the reſurrection. And this change of their bodies we have here ſet forth, from the <hi>manner, tearmes,</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>From the manner, or kind of it</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is not an
<hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,</hi> but <hi>accidentall tranſformation.</hi> Looke as in change of old, and broken veſſels, the matter is the ſame, onely the colour is freſher and brighter, the faſhion newer, and better: So in the reſurrection, our bodies ſhall be the ſame for ſubſtance. They ſhall retaine the ſame fleſh, and bloud, the ſame figure, and members, that now; onely they ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed with ſpirituall, and heavenly qualities, and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; of corruptible, they ſhall be made incorruptible; of paſſible, impaſſible; of earthy, heavenly: and this we have here expreſſed by the <hi>tearmes</hi> of this <hi>change, from which,</hi> and <hi>to which.</hi> It is a transformation of our bodies from vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a configuration, or conformation of them in glory unto the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. Here is <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> the tearme from which, vileneſſe,<pb n="366" facs="tcp:168371:185"/>our vile bodies. In the <hi>Greeke it</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the body of our vileneſſe; that is, by an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> our vile bodies, our moſt vile bodies. This vileneſſe is either <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> or
<hi>ſpeciall.</hi> 1. <hi>generall,</hi> common to all mankind, to wit, mortality, and paſſibility, obnoxiouſneſſe unto inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and diſeaſes, outward common calamities, and finally unto death, and corruption, 2. <hi>Speciall,</hi> accrewing unto the ſaints by perſecution,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17. Their bodies, while li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, may be blemiſhed with ſcars, wounds, diſmembring, and after death may many wayes be disfigured. Well! all defects, and blemiſhes ſhall be removed, and our bodies ſhall be faſhioned like unto Chriſts glorious body.</p>
            <p>Here we have the ſecond tearme of this change, the <hi>tearme unto which,</hi> glory: and this is ſet downe not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but in a way of compariſon, a compariſon of ſimilitude. This glory ſhall be like that of Chriſts body, in his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like unto his glorious body; and his glorious body, or body of glory, was cloathed with four glorious <hi>dotes,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, <hi>impaſſibility, ſubtilty, agility,</hi> and
<hi>clarity,</hi> For far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication of which, I ſhall referre you unto what I ſhall preſently deliver, on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42,43,44 Onely one thing I ſhall deſire you to remarke for the preſent, and that is this. Whereas divers <hi>Papiſts</hi> underſtand the ſubtilty of Chriſts body, in order unto the penetration of any other bodies, they are herein contradicted by ſome of their owne <hi>Schoolemen Durand, Capreolus,</hi> and
<hi>Eſtius.</hi> The two latter underſtand by it the perfect, and full ſubjection of the glorified body unto the glorified ſoule.

<hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eies; and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: For the former things are paſt away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A hot diſpute here is among the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> whether the
<hi>impaſſibilitie of glorified bodies be intrinſecall, or extrinſecall.</hi> Here we muſt premiſe with <hi>Durand,</hi> that glorious bodies are not <hi>impaſſible, per privationem principii paſſivi;</hi> for they ſhall conſiſt of matter, and there ſhall be in them a temper of elementary qualities, that have contraries.

That the fire did not conſume their bodies, it was not from any intrinſick impaſſibility in them, ariſing either from the want of paſſive power, or from ſomething ſeated in their bodies contrary unto fire, and ſo making head, and reſiſtance againſt it.

            <p>A ſecond prerogative of glorified bodies, that our Apoſtle ſpecifies, is <hi>glory,</hi> which is the ſame with that which the

If ſuch was the glory of the countenance of Stephen, &amp; Moſes, whileſt they were mortall, and fraile men here on earth; then how will the Countenance of glorified ſaints glitter, when they ſhall communicate in the glory of Chriſts owne body; for unto this the glory of Moſes, and Stephen's faces doth not bare ſo much proportion, as the light of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſtarre hath unto the ſplendour of the ſunne.

<hi>Capreolus,</hi> and <hi>Durand</hi> their expoſition of it, which, I confeſſe, is orthodox, but yet not the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this place: For a naturall body, unto which a ſpirituall body is here oppoſed, is in the Greeke, not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, an animal or ſoulie body, that is actuated, and animated by the ſoule after a naturall way, and manner, by the intervention of bodily helps, ſuch as eating, drinking, ſleeping, and the like. In all congruence of oppoſition <pb n="373" facs="tcp:168371:188"/>then,
<hi>ſpirituality</hi> is here oppoſed unto <hi>animality,</hi> and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body is ſaid to be ſpirituall, in regard of an <hi>immediate ſupportance</hi> by the ſpirit, without any corporall meanes, in an everlaſting, incorruptible, bleſſed, and glorious life. In <hi>the reſurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven, Math.</hi> 22.30. without any uſe of the generative, and nutritive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The Fourth, and laſt place, which I ſhall alleadge touching this particular, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. Where the full, and perfect glorification of the bodies of thoſe, that here receive the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, is tearmed <hi>Synecdochically</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the tearme from which it is, <hi>redemption,</hi> to wit, from all the puniſhments of ſinne; and in conformity hereunto the day of generall judgment, and reſurrection, is ſtiled the day of redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. There is a redemption by way <hi>of price,</hi> and a redemption by way of
<hi>power:</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of both our ſoules, and bodies, in a way of
<hi>price,</hi> was finiſhed by Chriſt, in the worke of his humiliation, and he reſted from it upon the day of his owne reſurrection. The redemption of our ſoules, <hi>by power,</hi> is perfected in the houre of death. But the redemption of our bodies, by <hi>power,</hi> will not be conſummated, untill the day of our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and then they ſhall be fully delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
            <p>And thus have I confirmed our future conformity, in ſoules, and bodies, unto the all fulneſſe of glory, that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the humanity of Chriſt. Now the certainty hereof ſhould comfort us againſt the
<hi>ſinfull corruptions of our ſoules,</hi> the naturall <hi>cumber and wearineſſe, the moſt ignominious defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> the moſt
<hi>painfull infirmities</hi> of our bodies, all other <hi>wants, and miſeries</hi> of our lives, and laſtly, the <hi>feare of death,</hi> a King of terrours unto all, that are out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. Againſt <hi>the ſinfull corruptions</hi> of our ſoules. There is no evill of ſo malignant a nature, as ſinne, and therefore nothing ſo great, and grievous a burden unto a pious, and ſanctified ſpirit; Nothing ſo ſtrong an argument for griefe, <pb n="374" facs="tcp:168371:189"/>and mourning. But now the aſſured hope of our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation unto Chriſts glory, will put due limits, and bounds unto this our ſorrow, ſo that it will keepe it from degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating into deſpaire, and keep us from being
<hi>ſwallowed up of over much ſorrow,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. for it aſſureth us, that all our corruptions ſhall one day be totally, and finally ſubdued, and we ſhall be endewed with a ſpotleſſe holineſſe, that cannot be defiled, and ſo ſhall be preſented
<hi>unblameable, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable in the ſight of God, Col.</hi> 1.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is comfort againſt the <hi>naturall cumber, and wearineſſe,</hi> the <hi>ignominious deformities, the painfull infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of</hi> our <hi>bodies, &amp;c.</hi> For our reſurrection will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious redemption from them all. Here many times our dull, and unactive bodies are unable, or unready to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to performe the deſires of our ſoules, and ſo are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome clogs, and not ſerviceable helps unto them. <hi>That, which is ſowed in weakeneſſe, ſhall be raiſed in power.</hi> Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodies ſhall be endewed with ſuch a power, as ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them moſt obedient, able, and agile inſtruments of their ſoules. The <hi>Speed</hi> of their motion ſhall be like that of the devouring fire in a heape of drie ſtubble, and the <hi>height</hi> of it ſhall ſurpaſſe the towring flight of the eagle: For they ſhall be able to <hi>meet the Lord in the aire,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. when he comes to judgment, and afterwards mount up unto the third, and higheſt heavens. Suppoſe we have blemiſhes, either <hi>naturall,</hi> or
<hi>contracted,</hi> that render us deformed in the ſight of men; Why the glory, and beautie of the reſurrection will exclude all defects. The moſt unhanſome, ill-favoured, and miſ-ſhapen body of a ſaint, ſhall be faſhioned like unto Chriſt's glorious body. Our bodies here are little better then receptacles of frailty, and paine, ſubject unto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inward diſtempers, or outward annoyances. But the impaſſibility, and clarity of our bodies in their glorified condition be will an abundant compenſation for all this. He, that can with an eye of faith behold the future configuration of his vile body unto Chriſts body of glory, will with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſupport his ſpirit under the tedious languiſhment of a lingering conſumption, under the raging violence of a<pb n="375" facs="tcp:168371:189"/>peſtilentiall feaver, under the otherwiſe unſupportable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the goute, cholick, ſtone, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the third place, he will patiently undergoe all <hi>other wants, and miſeries of this life.</hi> As for wants, he knoweth, that we have Gods promiſe to ſupply them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>God ſhall ſupply all your need, according</hi> unto <hi>his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> As for all the moſt grievous aflictions of this life, he expects a <hi>far more exceeding weight of glory,</hi> that will overpoyſe them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.

<hi>reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us, Rom.</hi> 8.18. This life unto the beſt is <hi>Bochim,</hi> a vale of teares. <hi>Here they ſow in teares, Pſal.</hi> 126.5. <hi>Thou feedeſt them with the bread of teares, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them teares to drink in great meaſure, Pſalm.</hi>
80.5. <hi>But light is ſowen for the righteous, and gladneſſe</hi> for the <hi>upright in heart, Pſalm.</hi> 97.11. and a glorious harveſt will come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhall reape in joy, and God <hi>ſhall wipe away all teares from their eies, Revel.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Man, that is borne of a woman, is of few dayes, and trouble, Job.</hi> 14.1. <hi>man is borne unto trouble, as the ſparkes flee upward, Job.</hi> 5.7. But there <hi>remaineth a reſt unto the people of God, Hebr.</hi> 4.9. <hi>a reſt from all their labours, Revel.</hi> 14.13. <hi>their hearts therefore may be glad,</hi> and their
<hi>glory may rejoyce, and their fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope, Pſalm.</hi> 16.9. who almoſt, but may take up that complaint of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 88.3. <hi>My ſoule</hi> is full <hi>of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</hi> But unto it, all Chriſt's members may oppoſe that which David ſpeaketh in the name of Chriſt himſelfe; <hi>Thou wilt make knowne unto mee the waies of life. Thou ſhalt make me full of joy with thy countenance, Act.</hi> 2.28. Here Gods people have <hi>waters of affliction of a full cup wrung out unto them, Pſalm.</hi> 73.10. Here they have a full draught of miſery; But againſt the bitterneſſe of this cup they may be <pb n="376" facs="tcp:168371:190"/>cheared by expectation of the <hi>river of divine pleaſures,</hi> the ſtreames thereof make glad the city of God, which God hath promiſed to make all thoſe drinke of, that put their truſt <hi>under the ſhadow of his wing:</hi> For with
<hi>him is the fountaine of life; in his light ſhall we ſee light, Pſalm.</hi> 36.8,9. Amongſt the miſeries of this life, we may well range the infamy of our names, and it is common, and incident to the moſt of men, Who almoſt ſo innocent, but hath occaſion to complaine as David,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.19,20. <hi>Thou haſt knowne my reproach, and my ſhame, and my diſhonour, &amp;c. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heavineſſe.</hi> Againſt this we ſhould comfort our ſelves with this confidence, that God will one day cleare up our reputations, and wipe away all obloquies from our names. <hi>The Lord Chriſt will come to be glorified in his ſaints, and to be admired in all them, that believe,</hi> 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. The Lord Chriſt will be the fountaine of their glory, and the meaſure of it will be unto admiration.</p>
            <p>Unto the reproaches, which the names of ſaints, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers lie under, we may add that, which miniſtreth no leſſe argument of griefe, and ſorrow unto a ſanctified ſoule; the <hi>unavoidable ſociety of the ungodly.</hi> How was <hi>juſt Lot vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.

120.5.</p>
            <p>But againſt this we muſt ſolace our ſelves by the hopes of Gods glorious preſence, in which we ſhall enjoy, as Chriſt now doth, fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for evermore at the right hand of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, here is comfort and encouragement unto thoſe, that are Chriſts, againſt the terrours of death; When we are as <hi>Joſhua and David, to goe the way of all the earth, Joſhua.</hi> 23.14. 1 <hi>Kings.</hi>
2.2. <hi>to die;</hi> This conſideration may comfort us, that God will ſhew us the path of life, make knowne unto us experimentally the waies of life. Nature trembleth to conſider, that one day it muſt deſcend downe into the throne of death, make it's bed in the duſt among wormes, and putrefaction. But Faith erects the ſoule by giving evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our future full vindication from all the diſhonour<pb n="377" facs="tcp:168371:190"/>of the grave, and full conformity unto the all-fulneſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the all-fulneſſe of glory that dwelleth in Chriſts humanity, may be applied in a way of <hi>exhortation.</hi>

            <p>1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is the pattern &amp; pledge of our owne fulneſſe of glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.

               </note> eternity is as it were a conqueſt of time, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meaſured thereby. Unto theſe everlaſting delights our ſoules ſhould be alwaies ſuſpiring. Here we are troubled with the paſſibility, animality, and weakneſſe of our bodies, and we dread all thoughts of the corruption and diſhonour of the grave; and therefore we ſhould ſigh and groane in our ſelves for the redemption of our bodies, we ſhould ardently wiſh and pray for incorruptible, powerfull, glorious, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies. The ſin of the ſoule is an heavier loade unto a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, then the frailty of the body. <hi>O wretched man, that I am,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death, Rom.</hi> 7.24. Why death it ſelfe will give a full and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deliverance; it will exempt as from the <hi>pollution</hi> of ſin, ſo from the vexation of all temptation to it. After death there will be no more any luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, no more any warring of the law in our members againſt the law of our minds, and bringing us into captivity unto the law of ſin, which is in our members, <hi>Rom.</hi>
7.23. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death is deſirable by all that are in Chriſt,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. ſo it be with ſubmiſſion unto the decree of God, with a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent contentation to ſerve our owne generation by the will of God,
<hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. To do firſt that ſervice for the Church, which God hath appointed us. No filthineſſe comparable unto that in the ſpot of ſin, and therefore how welcome ſhould a<pb n="378" facs="tcp:168371:191"/>glorified condition be unto us, in which we ſhall be without ſpot, blemiſh, wrinkle, or any ſuch thing. The mortification of ſin in this life is attended with the peace of conſcience, that paſſeth all underſtanding: but becauſe it is not perfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is often interrupted with ſtormes. But the utter eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſin is followed with a perpetuall calme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ardently deſired by all that know and prize tranquillity of Spirit. A cluſter of grapes cut down at the brook of Eſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col, and brought into the wilderneſſe, was very ſweet,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 13. Oh then how pleaſant will the whole vintage in the land of Canaan be! If the firſt fruites of our glory be ſo joyous, and delightfull, O then the comfort that we ſhall reap in the whole crap, or harveſt! The fulneſſe and perfection of our glory is ſuch, as never entered into the heart of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. The glory of Chriſt in his transfiguration on the mount was ſo ſatisfactory unto Peter, as that he deſired his ſight of it might never have end or interruption. Then <hi>anſwered Peter and ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and one for Elias.</hi> And yet Peter was only a <hi>ſpectator</hi> of this glory, and had himſelfe no ſhare in it. O then what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſatisfaction may we expect in the beholding of Chriſts glory in heaven! for it will be accompanied with an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting enjoyment thereof; the luſtre of it will be diffuſed unto us, ſo that <hi>ſome ſhall enjoy the glory of the Sun, ſome of the Moone, ſome of the Starres,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. We may conclude then of heaven, as Peter of the mount of Chriſts transfiguration,
<hi>Lord it is good for us to be here.</hi> In earth we are ſurrounded with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of diſcontent, but in heaven the glory of Chriſt will be an all-pleaſing object: for in the ſight of it will ſtand part of our bliſſe, and therefore it ſhould command our hearts, and draw unto it our thoughts, and affections. Chriſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is our treaſure, and where your
<hi>treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo, Math.</hi> 6.21. Whereſoever the <hi>body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together, Luk.</hi> 17.37. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.28. <hi>Hoſea chap.</hi> 1.11. Propheſying of the true members of the Church under the Goſpell, giveth them this character. <hi>They ſhall appoint themſelves one head;</hi> and
<hi>aſcendent<pb n="379" facs="tcp:168371:191"/>è terrâ, they ſhall come up out of the land:</hi> that is, they ſhall aſcend from earth to heaven in their deſires. In <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.3. the motion of the Church, even here in her ſtate militant, is aſcenſion. <hi>Who is this that commeth up out of the wilderneſſe.</hi> Though ſhe be in a wilderneſſe condition, yet the <hi>texminus ad quem</hi> of all her motions, is the land of promiſe, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem; ſhe is ſtill comming up out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The conſtant prayer of the Church is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of her Lord, and Husband, Chriſt Jeſus. and the ſpirit dictates this prayer unto her.
<hi>The ſpirit and the bride ſay, come, Revel.</hi> 22.17. She knoweth, that the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming will be her wedding day; And hath ſhe not reaſon to long for the conſummation of her marriage with ſo all-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an husband. She is aſſured, that the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming will be her coronation day, wherein he will grant her to <hi>ſit with him in his throne, Revel.</hi> 3.21. and place upon her head a crowne <hi>of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.8. <hi>of life, Jam.</hi> 1.12.
<hi>and glory,</hi> that <hi>fadeth not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. What more tempting and alluring, then the beauty of ſuch a crowne, the glory of ſuch a throne! And therefore ſhe hath great cauſe to love the appearing of the Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.8. and to deſire, that it may be haſtened.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>From Chriſt's all-fulneſſe</hi> of glory, and the certainty that we have of our participation thereof, we may be exhorted to uſe our ſtricteſt endeavours in our declining of ſinne, purſuite of holineſſe, and tracing the waies of new obedience. Hath not Chriſt decreed to make us glorious like himſelfe. The <hi>glory which thou gaveſt me,</hi> I <hi>have given them, Joh.</hi> 17.22. and is it not then a very undecent thing for us, to have here inglorious ſoules, baſe and unworthy affections, and converſations? He hath prepared for us riches of glory; And unto ſuch riches will not poore and low ſoules be unſuitable? We are begotten by the refurrection of Jeſus Chriſt unto a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. and unto ſuch an undefiled, and heavenly inheritance will not defiled conſciences, and earthy minds be altogeather diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo unqualified, and unmeete for the partaking of it?<pb n="380" facs="tcp:168371:192"/>If you compare <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21. of 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> you may find an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ſtirre us up unto heavenly mindedneſſe. We <hi>looke from heaven for the ſaviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore let <hi>our converſation be in heaven.</hi> Here on earth, as it was ſaid of Lazarus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25.
<hi>we receive our evill things.</hi> Even a Jacob complaines of the <hi>few dayes of his</hi> Pilgrimage, as <hi>evill, Gen.</hi> 47.9. and unto a Solomon all <hi>things under the ſunne</hi> were <hi>vanity, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2. and therefore while our bodies are faſtened unto the earth, this theater of miſery, our ſoules ſhould ſoare up to heaven in devotion. Becauſe thoſe, that have choſen Chriſt for their Head, and King, ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from earth to heaven in their bodies at the reſurrection, <hi>aſcendent è terra, Hoſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>They ſhall come up out of the land;</hi> therefore it is fit, that now in this life they ſhould <hi>come up out of the land,</hi> aſcend, and mount unto heaven by divine, and ſpirituall meditations, and heavenly affections. When Chriſt took <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to be witneſſes of his glorious transfiguration, he <hi>bringeth them up into a high mountaine apart, Math.</hi> 17.1. and why might not this betoken, that to qualifie us for the contemplation of Chriſt's glory here, and the fruition of it hereafter, there is requiſite an elevation, and ſeparation of our hearts from the diſtractions of all things here below.</p>
            <p>Saint John having propounded our future conformitie unto Chriſt's glory, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.2. <hi>when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, &amp;c.</hi> he preſently addeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. that the hope of this conformitie is accompanied with unfeigned endeavours after purity; and <hi>every man, that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelfe, even as he is pure.</hi> And indeed it would be very irrationall for a man to hope to be like Chriſt in his glory, and happineſſe, and at the ſame time to reſolve to be unlike him in his grace, and holineſſe. In <hi>Rom.</hi>
8.23. they, that <hi>waite for the Adoption,</hi> that is, the conſummation, and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their adoption, to wit, the <hi>redemption of their bodies,</hi> are deſcribed by the Apoſtle to be holy, and penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as have the <hi>firſt fruits of the ſpirit, Gal.</hi>
5.22,23.<pb n="381" facs="tcp:168371:192"/>and ſuch as <hi>groane within themſelves,</hi> that is, under the ſight and ſenſe of their luſts, and corruptions. This connexion of ſpirituall ſorrow, and humiliation, with the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, is very congruent; becauſe there is a great deale of equity in this, that we ſhould mourne, and groane for that, which grieveth the Spirit, by whoſe graces we are <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> that is, marked out for <hi>redemption, Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. <hi>In heaven the ſpirits of juſt men ſhall ſhall be made perfect, Epheſ.</hi> 12.23. and if we deſire after death to be rankt amongſt them, we ſhould labour by the promiſes to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>perfecting holineſſe in the feare of God,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. to be <hi>perfect, as our father, which is in heaven, is perfect, Math.</hi> 5.48. When we awake, ſatisfaction with the image or likeneſſe of God will be our reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ. laſt.</hi> and therefore here it is our duty to put on the new man, which is renewed after the image of God. When our ſoules are ſinleſſe, then they ſhall be compleatly happy; and therefore the inchoatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bliſſe conſiſteth in repentance for, &amp; mortification of ſinne. The veſſell of our bodies ſhall one day be repleniſhed with glory, &amp; therefore every one ſhould <hi>know how to poſſeſſe it in ſanctification, and honour,</hi> not <hi>in the luſt of concupiſcence,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.4. Chriſt will faſhion our bodies like <hi>unto his glorious body,</hi> and therefore unfitting to debaſe them unto the drudgery of ſinne. O how can they hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be meete receptacles of, and qualified ſubjects for glory, if we wholly make them the inſtruments of our luſts; and their members weapons of unrighteouſneſſe? <hi>veſſels unto honour</hi> ſhould purge
<hi>themſelves</hi> from <hi>veſſels unto diſhonour,</hi> and not proſtitute themſelves unto ſuch ſordid uſes, as thoſe are applied unto, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21. If we are veſſels of mercy, which God hath prepared unto glory, and on whom he will make knowne the riches of his glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. we ſhall be very ungratefull, if we doe not glorify him in our bodies, and ſpirits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. if we employ any faculty of <hi>this,</hi> or member of <hi>that,</hi> unto his diſhonour. The bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glorious ſaints in heaven is to ſee God face to face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. to ſee Chriſt, as he is, 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. And therefore for this every gracious ſaint prepareth by ſeeking his face<pb n="382" facs="tcp:168371:193"/>here in his ordinances.
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 27.8. Becauſe God will one day make knowne unto us the wayes of life, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.11. in a way of poſſeſſion, therefore it is fit that now we apply our ſelves unto Gods ſhewing us the way of life in the way of inſtruction and revelation. Our conſtant prayer ſhould be that of Davids, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 25.4,5. Shew me thy waies, o Lord, teach me thy paths, lead me in thy truth and teach me. Chriſt prayeth in the behalfe of all the elect, thoſe <hi>whom</hi> his father <hi>hath given him,</hi> that <hi>they may be where</hi> he is, <hi>and that they may there behold,</hi> that is, enjoy his glory, which <hi>God hath given him, John</hi> 17.24. Now unto this prayer our ſoules do not ſay a hearty
<hi>Amen,</hi> unleſſe they pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſſemblies of the ſaints, and communion with Chriſt in them, as the hart panteth after the water brookes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42.1,2. <hi>Where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of Chriſt,</hi> there hath he promiſed to be in the midſt of them, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.20. And they that loath ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, would ſoon be tired and cloyed with the happineſſe of heaven. There are perſons loathing Chriſt, and loathed by him: thoſe that principally affect ſuch, and delight moſt in their felloſhip and company, do not cordially care to come where Chriſt now is in his exalted condition; and if their hearts were left unto their liberty of choice, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the pleaſures of paradiſe for thoſe of an alebench or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, if they were perpetuall. And if it were poſſible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to have a view of the glory, which God hath given Chriſt, they would quickly be weary of ſo happy a ſight, and turne away their eies from beholding it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I at laſt gone over the ſeverall branches of that all-fulneſſe which dwelleth in Chriſt I ſhall briefly inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome uſes that may be made of them, conſidered jointly, and ſo I ſhall put a concluſion unto my meditations upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Theſe Uſes ſhall be either of <hi>information, exhortation,</hi> or <hi>conſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of <hi>Information,</hi> and they ſhall be two.</p>
            <p>1. From this all-fulneſſe that dwelleth in Chriſt, we may inferre his incomprehenſibleneſſe. He is a <hi>mine,</hi> unto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome<pb n="383" facs="tcp:168371:193"/>of which we can never digge. He is <hi>an ocean,</hi> that can never be fathomed. His <hi>riches</hi> are ſaid to be unſearchable, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. which <hi>Epithet</hi> denoteth the
<hi>undiſcoverableneſſe</hi> of them by the light of nature, the
<hi>incomprehenſibleneſſe</hi> of them by the light of faith.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>abſolute undiſcoverableneſſe</hi> of them by the <hi>light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Fleſh and bloud can never reveale them; ſo that without divine revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we had been as utterly ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the world was of the mines of <hi>America,</hi> before the diſcovery of
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is to find out by the footſteps. The riches of Chriſt are not to be traced out by any footſteps of them: for in the whole book of the creature, there are no
<hi>veſtigia,</hi> no prints left of them.</p>
            <p>2. The riches of Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>unſearchable</hi> in regard of their <hi>incomprehenſibleneſſe</hi> by the light of faith. We may comprehend them <hi>manu,</hi> not <hi>viſu,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. That faith which is moſt quick ſighted, doth not reach a full, adequate, and comprehenſive knowledge of them: Of the riches of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it hath only a glimpſe, and that a farr off: The riches of grace, redemption, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. it ſeeth only darkly, and dimmely, as through a glaſſe; and then the riches of his divine perſon and nature are abſolutely infinite, and therefore cannot be comprehended by the finite underſtanding of man: For between the object comprehended, and the power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty comprehending, there muſt be a proportion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which is finite, and that which is infinite, there is no proportion. As the Apoſtle ſaith here of the riches of Chriſt in generall, that they are unſearchable, ſo in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. he affirmeth particularly concerning the treaſures <hi>of wiſdome and knowledge</hi> in Chriſt, that they are
<hi>hidden,</hi> and they are ſaid to be <hi>hidden,</hi> becauſe they are totally and altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the unregenerate, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.16.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. And becauſe they are but ſparingly and in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here in this life manifeſted unto the regenerate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
            <p>2. From this <hi>all-fulneſſe</hi> that dwelleth in Chriſt, we may inferre the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>preciouſneſſe</hi> of the calling of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: <pb n="384" facs="tcp:168371:194"/>for it is by God deſigned unto the propoſall and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this all-fulneſſe unto the ſons of men: and what calling or office can have a richer, a more noble, and diviner object? We have (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>this treaſure in earthen veſſels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Though the moſt faithfull, holy, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent miniſters of the Goſpell be but earthen veſſels, yet they hold a divine and heavenly treaſure. In Chriſt are hid all the treaſures of grace, of wiſdome, and knowledge. And mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are Chriſts
<hi>Almoners</hi> and cofferers, to diſtribute theſe treaſures unto poor, hungry, and naked ſoules. And what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment can be more honourable in it ſelfe, and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall unto a man, by the fall of Adam ſunke into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of want and poverty? The Apoſtle Paul acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that to preach the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, was a great grace given unto him,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. where I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of three things.</p>
            <p>1. The riches of Chriſt were either ſuch as he <hi>was poſſeſt of in himſelfe,</hi> or ſuch as he <hi>communicatth unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Such as he is poſſeſt of in himſelfe,</hi> The riches of his perſon, and natures, his rich and glorious offices, the riches of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, merit, ſpirit, knowledge, power, and glory.</p>
            <p>2. Such as he <hi>communicateth</hi> unto us, the riches of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſanctification, and glorification.</p>
            <p>2. To unfold the Metaphor, <hi>riches</hi> imply 1.
<hi>plenty.</hi> 2. plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things, that are of <hi>price</hi> and
<hi>value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Theſe riches are ſaid to be <hi>unſearchable,</hi> becauſe undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by the meere light of nature, though never ſo much improved; and becauſe incomprehenſible by the light of grace, though never ſo much raiſed. Now to apply all this to our preſent purpoſe: here be three things in the object of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtudy and worke, to ſet forth the dignity of his office. 1. <hi>Largeneſſe.</hi> 2.
<hi>Preciouſneſſe.</hi> 3. <hi>Myſteriouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is a large, wide, and extenſive object;</hi> Riches, and riches ſo unſearchable, as that they can never be counted or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up by any created underſtanding.</p>
            <p>2. It is a precious and rich object; <hi>riches,</hi> and
<hi>riches</hi> of Chriſt. Unto all riches things of worth are required. But theſe riches are of an extraordinary nature; <hi>they</hi> are <hi>of Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:168371:194"/>and therefore divine, and heavenly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is a <hi>myſterious,</hi> deepe, and abſtruſe object. The riches of Chriſt are unſearchable: for nature

               </gap>an make no diſcovery of them at all; and even grace can make but a very defective, and inadequate diſcovery of them. <hi>We know but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
            <p>2. From the <hi>all-fulneſſe that</hi> dwelleth in Chriſt, I ſhall inferre, and preſſe two Exhortations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt ſhall be unto thoſe,</hi> that as yet have
<hi>no intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> Becauſe there dwelleth in him all-fullneſſe, therefore he is an all-ſatisfying object, an object that will quiet, and content the ſoule of a man; and therefore hence they may be
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted</hi> unto a moſt <hi>diligent appliance</hi> of themſelves unto thoſe meanes, by which God ordinarily unites unto Chriſt thoſe, whom he hath given him among'ſt the ſonnes of men. Out of Chriſt, it fareth with a ſoule as with <hi>Noah's dove</hi> at her firſt ſending forth, before the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. She <hi>can find no reſt for the ſole of her foot, Gen.</hi> 8.8,9. All the honours, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, that the moſt ambitious hopes can fancy to it ſelfe; All the riches, &amp; treaſures, that both the Indies can afford, the <hi>treaſures of darkeneſſe, and hidden riches of ſecret places, Eſay.</hi> 45.3.
<hi>the precious things of the earth, and the fulneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Deut.</hi>
33.16. <hi>the fulneſſe of the wine preſſe, Numb.</hi> 18.27. <hi>the hid treaſure, with which God filleth the belly of the men of this world, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. to be filled with the <hi>fineſt,</hi> or <hi>fat of</hi> the <hi>wheat, Pſal.</hi> 147.14. All theſe cannot yield full ſatisfaction unto a reaſonable ſoule, in that they will ſtill prove
<hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate unto it's na ure,</hi> which is ſpirituall, and <hi>to it's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> which is boundleſſe, and therefore muſt needs leave the ſoule unquiet, the mind unſatisfied, alwaies flitting from one thing unto another, the deſires ſtill roving, and reſtleſſe, ſtill longing after higher honours, and more riches; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as our Saviour ſaith, a <hi>mans life conſiſteth not in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things, which he poſſeſſeth, Luk.</hi> 12.15. But now Chriſt, and his fulneſſe, are proportionable both unto the ſpirituall nature, and boundleſſe capacities of our ſoules; and therefore abundantly ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:168371:195"/>1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto their ſpirituall nature,</hi> that his fullneſſe will ſuite and fit well enough, in that it is ſpirituall. His riches, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, his feaſt of fat things, of fat things full of marrow, &amp;c. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 25.6. are all ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto their boundleſſe capacitie:</hi> for his fulneſſe is an all full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; in ſome particulars of it, there is an abſolute infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as in the fulneſſe of his God head, in the fulneſſe of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction &amp; merit: &amp; therefore, there is in it an all-ſufficiency to ſatisfie the deſires of the ſoules. Hereupon he is tearmed the <hi>deſire of all nations, Hag.</hi> 2.7. not onely a perſon deſired, or deſirable in the concrete, but
<hi>deſire,</hi> in the abſtract Now this importeth, ſaith <hi>Biſhop Lake</hi> upon the words, that he is <hi>totus deſiderabilis, altogeather, and in every part deſirable,</hi> and <hi>totum deſiderabile, whatſoever the heart of man can deſire, all that can be deſired.</hi> Eſau
<hi>ſaid unto his father, haſt thou not reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a bleſſing for me, haſt thou but one bleſſing, O my father? Bleſſe me, even me alſo, O my father, Gen.</hi> 27.36,38. There is no colour for any ſuch language unto Chriſt: for in him dwelleth all-fulneſſe of bleſſings; bleſſings enough to ſatisfie the deſire of all believers in all nations. He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a bleſſing for the Gentiles, ſo that they partake of the roote, and fatneſſe of the olive-tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.
<note place="margin">

I wiſh for nothing but this, that I may alwaies feed on, reliſh, and taſt of thy ſweetneſſe, fatneſſe, and fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Unto this <hi>proportion,</hi> that is in Chriſts fulneſſe, unto the ſoule, adde we in the next place, the <hi>perpetuitie</hi> hereof, Chriſt<pb n="387" facs="tcp:168371:195"/>is as a ſuitable, ſo <hi>an eternall</hi> good unto the ſoule: For this all-fulneſſe will dwell in him unto all eternitie. He is that tree of life ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.2. that
<hi>ſhall beare twelve manner of fruits,</hi> and yield <hi>her fruit every moneth.</hi> He ſhall be no wither'd, no barren tree, but fruitfull; and the fruit, that he ſhall beare, ſhall be precious: He ſhall be a tree of life. Next, it ſhall be plentifull, <hi>twelve manner of fruits.</hi> Unto it, laſtly, there ſhall agree a laſting verdure, and freſhneſſe,
<hi>It ſhall yield</hi> fruit every moneth: There ſhall be with it a perpetuall Autumne. A <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſsadour.</hi> when the
<hi>Venetians</hi> made oſtentation unto him of their vaſt and repleniſhed treaſurie, he told them that their treaſurie had no roote, and therefore might ſoone be drained: But the treaſury of his maſter had a roote, the mines of <hi>America,</hi> ſo that when his coffers were emptie, he could quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh them againe. All terreſtriall treaſures, and riches, are rootleſſe, and therefore may be conſumed, and end in want, and poverty. But the ſpirituall riches and treaſures of a Chriſtian have an eternall roote in the heavens, the all-ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that dwelleth in Chriſt, and therefore can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; although they may be much diminiſhed, when by ſins of preſumption they put a ſtop unto ſome influences of this unwithered roote.</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid ſerveth to ſhew us the miſerable eſtate of men without Chriſt: for without him, in themſelves, and in all things elſe, there is nothing, but vanity and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. In him alone there dwelleth all-fulneſſe. And if they have no part in him, how can they partake of the bleſſed influence of his fulneſſe. As there can be no ſap in thoſe branches, which have no true union with the roote: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any true, and ſaving good in thoſe men, which are not ingrafted into the true vine, Chriſt Jeſus; they may have a great deale of worldly treaſure to lay up for themſelves, but as our Saviour ſaith,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.21. <hi>They are not rich towards God. In the fulneſs of their ſufficiency they ſhall be in great ſtreights, Job.</hi> 20.22. and wants: for they have not the <hi>love of God,</hi> in whoſe <hi>favour is life, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. They are voide of the <hi>image,</hi> and ſpirit of God, the earneſt of that<pb n="388" facs="tcp:168371:196"/>inheritance, which God reſerveth for his ſons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall never ſee the face of God, never enjoy the <hi>life of God.</hi> But in the ſtate of diſunion from Chriſt there is not onely an utter emptineſſe of any ſaving good, but alſo a fulneſſe of all evill <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.31. and 14.14.
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 31.23. a <hi>fulneſſe of ſinne</hi> and <hi>a fulneſſe of miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A <hi>fulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> As the earth upon the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the ſunne is covered with darkneſſe, and with many thick, and groſſe vapours, fogs, and miſts: ſo the ſoule, upon the abſence of Chriſt, is overſpread with ſpirituall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with ignorance, with ſinne, with noyſome and corrupt luſts.</p>
            <p>And upon this <hi>ſecondly,</hi> there will follow another fulneſſe, a <hi>fulneſſe of miſery, and unhappineſſe. They ſhall be filled with miſchiefe, Prov.</hi> 12.21. They <hi>ſhall be filled with drunkenneſſe, and ſorrow, with the cup of aſtoniſhment and deſolation, Ezek.</hi> 23.33. Sometimes God gives many of them a foretaſt of their future fulneſſe of miſery in the horrible terrours of their guilty conſciences. The ſeven Angells poure out upon the heads and hearts of wicked men, even here in this life, <hi>ſeven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, Revel.</hi> 15.7. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes in <hi>Heb.</hi>
10.27. of a <hi>certaine fearfull looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> But alas! the
<hi>expectance</hi> of hell is but a flea-biting in compariſon of the
<hi>experience of it.</hi> For this is the full wages of wickedneſſe, and the higheſt degree of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſin. One reaſon, why ſuch as are reprobated from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with Chriſt, are called
<hi>veſſels of wrath, Rom.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, becauſe they ſhall be filled with the wrath of God, and all the direfull fruits thereof; they ſhall be filled with all the fulneſſe of Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhall be like the
<hi>full roll</hi> of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel chap.</hi> 2.9,10. that <hi>was written within, and without;</hi> and the contents thereof were <hi>lamentations, and mourning, and woe:</hi> they ſhall be not only miſerable, but all over miſerable, miſerable in both ſoules and bodies; they ſhall not only be full of miſery, but the very fulneſſe of miſery ſhall be in them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond exhortation ſhall be addreſſed unto thoſe that
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:168371:196"/>have already relation unto him; and it is, to labour after <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlargements in their participation of his fulneſſe.</hi> For in him dwelleth all-fulneſſe, and of that we can never partake enough. In him are unſearchable riches and treaſures, and therefore we can never come unto the bottome. We ſhould not therefore put any ſtop, or ſuffer any diverſion in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to be inriched by him. To provoke hereunto, I ſhall propound by way of <hi>motive,</hi> Chriſts
<hi>willingneſſe</hi> to impart of his fulneſſe, his
<hi>invitation</hi> of us to receive it.

            <p>1. The <hi>Actuation</hi> the ſtirring up of our faith, which is our receiving, and acceptance of Chriſts fulneſſe. There is a fulneſſe of light in the ſunne, but it illightneth none, but thoſe, who open their eyes to admit, &amp; make uſe of it's light. There dwelleth an all-fulneſſe in Chriſt; But what advantage can we expect thereby, unleſſe we open our hearts to receive of it? This all-fulneſſe is the vniverſall foode of the whole Church. It <hi>is a feaſt of fat things, of fat things full of marrow,<pb n="391" facs="tcp:168371:197"/>Eſay.</hi> 25.6. But our hungry ſoules will receive but little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction thereby, unleſſe by faith we feed on the ſeverall diſhes, that are therein.

The Church hath in Chriſt breaſts of Conſolation, an abundance of glory, but ſhe muſt ſuck, before ſhe can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with theſe breaſts; She muſt milke out, before ſhe can be delighted with abundance of glory,
<hi>Eſay.</hi> 66.11. Chriſt is the bread of life; but the bread of life cannot quicken, &amp; nouriſh, unleſſe we eat of it: In him are the waters of life, but theſe waters cannot refreſh, and comfort, unleſſe we drinke liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them: And <hi>he that believeth, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water, John.</hi> 7.37. Thoſe of the children of men, that <hi>put their truſt under the ſhadow of the Lords wings,</hi> that is, true believers <hi>ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of his houſe,</hi> and he <hi>ſhall make them to drinke of the river of his pleaſures, Pſam.</hi> 36.7,8. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deepe, Joh.</hi> 4.11.

Let us let downe this bucket into this well: Let us actuate, and exerciſe our faith upon the all-fulneſſe, that is in Chriſt, and hereby with joy we ſhall draw water out of the wells of ſalvation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this well is of infinite depth, the bucket of our faith is of a narrow capacitie, and our wants are continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; for the ſupply of which, we muſt alwaies be letting downe, and drawing up this bucket of faith: We muſt not ſuffer it to be idle, but ſet it alwaies a worke: What the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes concerning the revelation of one part of Chriſt's fulneſſe, the fulneſſe of his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. may be applied unto the revelation, and communication of other parcels thereof: They are revealed, and communicated proportionably unto the growth, and progreſſe of our faith; <hi>From faith to faith.</hi>

               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:168371:198"/>A <hi>ſecond</hi> help, that will conduce much unto the enlargement of our participation of Chriſt's fulneſſe, is an increaſe in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>poverty, humility, ſelf deniall,</hi> and
<hi>apprehenſion of our utter emptineſſe</hi> in ſpirituals. For this emptieth a man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and the more a man is emptied of himſelfe, the more roome is made for the fulneſſe of Chriſt, and ſo a ſoule is the better fitted and prepared for the reception thereof. <hi>Every valley,</hi> every lowly ſoule ſhall be filled, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The humble valleys are covered over with corne, Pſalm.</hi> 65.13. whiles the high hills are barren.

Thoſe who are rich and full onely in a proud opinion, he ſlightingly diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, they get nothing of his fulneſſe: and no wonder; for they reliſh it not, they make no reckoning of it.

            <p>The <hi>third</hi> meanes qualifying and fitting of us for receipts out of Chriſts fulneſſe, is <hi>hunger and thirſt</hi> after it: For this in ſome ſort enlargeth the capacity of the ſoule, makes it more capacious and comprehenſive of Chriſts fulneſſe, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it could be. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſalm.</hi> 81.10. Deſire is the <hi>mouth</hi> of the ſoule: if that be widened, we have Gods promiſe for the filling of our ſoules. Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the inſeparable curſe of inordinate and unlawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But holy and heavenly deſires are ſtill rewarded with the bleſſing of ſatisfaction. <hi>Bleſſed are they which doe hunger, and thirſt after righteouſneſſe; for they ſhall be filled, Math.</hi> 5.6.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:168371:198"/>
               <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good things, Luk.</hi>
1.53. <hi>He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyeth the longing ſoule, and filleth the hungry ſoule with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Pſalm.</hi> 107.9. <hi>I will powre water upon him that is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and flouds upon the dry ground, Iſa.</hi> 44.3. A thirſty ſoule is here reſembled unto dry ground, unto the earth in a great drought, when it doth as it were gape for raine: upon ſuch a ſoule (ſaith God) I will powre not drops, but flouds. <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 63.1. profeſſeth a very earneſt deſire after commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in Chriſt.
<hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeeke thee: my ſoule thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land, where no water is:</hi> and hereupon <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. he promiſeth unto himſelfe ſweet and full ſatisfaction. <hi>My ſoule ſhall be ſatisfyed, as with marrow, and fatneſſe.</hi> That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, and <hi>Timothy,</hi> in reference unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. is applicable unto Chriſt in order unto all Chriſtians.
<hi>His mouth is open unto us, his heart enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. We are not ſtraightned in him, but we are ſtraightned in our owne bowels;</hi> that is, in our narrow affections, which are not in any meaſure of proportion correſponſive unto the all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that dwelleth in him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt help</hi> which I ſhall adviſe unto, for enlargment of our participation from Chriſts fulneſſe, is a <hi>diligent uſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:</hi> for theſe are the Inſtruments, by which Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth of his fulneſſe. Theſe are the two <hi>golden pipes,</hi> by which the <hi>two Olive branches,</hi> the two natures of Chriſt, or his two offices, Regall, and Prieſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> empty the golden oyle out of themſelves, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.12. Theſe are the wings, that is, the beames and rayes of the Sun of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. the
<hi>vehicula</hi> of its influence. In <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 36.8. we have a promiſe of ſweet and abundant ſatisfaction unto Believers, but it is affixed unto the ordinances of God. <hi>They ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfyed with the fatneſſe of thy houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Paul <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.29. aſſureth himſelfe touching his coming among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> is appliable in ſome degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtery of even ordinary paſtours and teachers. It is in the
<hi>fulneſſe of the bleſſing of the Goſpell of Chriſt:</hi> that is, as <hi>Lyra</hi> gloſſeth it, in the abundance of ſpirituall grace; ſo that their congregations, if they receive the Goſpell with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe<pb n="394" facs="tcp:168371:199"/>of mind, ſhall (to uſe the words of
<hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place) <hi>ſpiritualibus Evangelii divitiis affluere,</hi> abound in all ſpirituall riches of the Goſpell. God ordinarily doth ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſe the labours of pious and painfull miniſters, as that for a ſeale of their miniſtry, he makes them inſtrumentall in imparting unto Gods people in their flocks, not onely ſome
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. but all ſpirituall gifts, and <hi>graces, that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſaving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, here is a word of <hi>Conſolation</hi> for every ſoule, that is united unto Chriſt. We may ſay of Chriſt, what the wiſe man did of his feare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.23. <hi>He that hath him, ſhall abide ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed: he ſhall not be viſited with evill.</hi> What the <hi>Poëts</hi> fancied of their <hi>cornu copia,</hi> may more truly be averred of Chriſt: that, as they feigned, afforded them, who poſſeſſed it, whatſover they deſired. And Chriſt yeilds unto them, who have intereſt in him, a ſupply of all that they can lawfully, and will throughly and effectually wiſh and aske for. It is but asking, and we have Chriſts promiſe to receive, <hi>that our joy may be full, Joh.</hi>
16.24. <hi>He is plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon him, Pſalm.</hi> 86.5. There dwelleth an all fulneſſe in the head, and therefore there cannot be an emptineſſe in any of the members; for he received this all-fulneſſe for them, and therefore he will either
<hi>derive unto</hi> them, or <hi>imploy for</hi> them, every parcell of it. In him there is, as fulneſſe, ſo bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: he is, as full, ſo bountifull, moſt ready to impart unto others that fulneſſe, which for their ſakes he is poſſeſſed of. We may ſay of him, what Solomon doth of the clouds, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.3. <hi>If they be full of raine, they empty themſelves upon the earth.</hi> Chriſt is full of every deſirable good, and he will empty himſelfe upon every one, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto him. In ſome ſort he communicates unto them moſt particulars of his fulneſſe. He imployeth the fulneſſe of his <hi>office</hi> and
<hi>authority,</hi> and he layeth out the fulneſſe of his
<hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> to promote their ſalvation: He communicates unto them even the very fulneſſe of his <hi>Godhead</hi> in a way of <hi>anology</hi> and reſemblance. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of an <hi>Analogicall</hi> partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. The fulneſſe of his <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> with God, he makes uſe of to ingratiate us<pb n="395" facs="tcp:168371:199"/>with God, and he makes us the objects of his owne fulneſſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> As for the fulneſſe of his <hi>habituall grace,</hi> we have the very ſame grace for
<hi>kind,</hi> imparted unto us, though farre different in <hi>meaſure. We receive of his fulneſſe grace for grace, John.</hi> 1.16. The fulneſſe of his <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is communicated unto us by
<hi>imputation,</hi> that is, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is accepted for us unto our juſtification From his <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory,</hi> he will derive ſome beames unto us: He will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion our bodies unto an imitation of his glorious body: And unto this there will be preſuppoſed in our ſoules a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the glory and happineſſe of his ſoule: for the body is happy and glorious by <hi>redundancy</hi> from the ſoule. <hi>This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> what is there that ſhould perplex a ſoule, that is in a ſtate of Union with Chriſt? Is it wants and emptineſſe? why it hath the all-fulneſſe of Chriſt to gage for a ſupply. Is it its owne impotency and diſability? why! unto that it may oppoſe Chriſts all-ſufficiency. Though we be not able of our ſelves to contribute any thing towards our ſalvation, yet he that hath undertaken the worke, is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt, and he is alſo authorized hereunto. He hath all power given unto him in heaven &amp; earth, a fulneſſe of office and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Is Originall corruption a trouble unto them, that rendred them children of wrath in their cradles, and in the wombe? Againſt the diſcomfort of that, they ſhould ſet Chriſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace and favour with God: for this will purchaſe the grace of Adoption for all that are his. He is the ſon of Gods love, and therefore in him he will be well pleaſed with them. Doe they complaine as the <hi>Pſalmiſt, we are exceedingly filled with contempt. Our ſoule is exceedingly filled with the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe, that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud, Pſalm.</hi> 123.3,4. Why! upon this they would look with an eye of contempt, if they did but conſider, how their bleſſed Saviour is full of grace, love, and favour, towards them. Are they diſquieted with the ſight, and ſenſe of the defects, and imperfections that are in their graces? why! they are covered with the fulneſſe of Chriſts <hi>habituall grace and holineſſe.</hi> Is the vaſt guilt of their actuall enormities a terrour unto them? why<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all their ſins are ſwallowed up by the fulneſſe and infiniteneſſe <pb n="396" facs="tcp:168371:200"/>of Chriſts fatisfaction. Doe they grieve for the blemiſhes of their good workes, which are ſo farre from meriting heaven, as that they ſupererogate for hell and damnation? Why! though there be a neceſſity of doing good workes,
<hi>neceſſitas praecepti,</hi> and <hi>medii;</hi> yet there is no need of
<hi>meriting</hi> by them: for our <hi>Head</hi> by his infinite merits hath purchaſed more glory then our natures are capable of. And of this fulneſſe of glory he is poſſeſſed now in heaven in our behalfe, as our <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and in his appointed time, the <hi>times of reſtitution of all things,</hi> he will derive of this his fulneſſe of glory unto us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto our capacity, which he confirmeth and aſſureth unto us, by <hi>his promiſe</hi> in the Goſpell, by the
<hi>earneſt</hi> of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our hearts.</p>
